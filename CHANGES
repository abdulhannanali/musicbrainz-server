Changes for Version 1.0.0pre3
-----------------------------

- New HTML design. Design and many thanks go to Phester (ceo@phester.org)
- The database now allows more arbitrary album <-> track and GUID <--> track
  associations. For this change, the Track table no longer has an Artist or
  GUID fields. Instead, we now have a GUID table to keep track of GUIDs,
  a GUIDJoin table to associate GUIDs with Tracks and an AlbumJoin to
  associate tracks with albums in a nice and flexible manner.
- The Artist table now also has a SortName column that can be used when a list
  of artists is displayed. So name might contain 'The Beatles' and sortname
  should contain 'Beatles, The'.
- The perl modules are broken down into seperate modules, rather than one
  large MusicBrainz.pm.
- The top moderators and server statistics are shown in the sidebar and
  update once an hour.
- The sponsors now have graphics on the page. The actual look of that box
  will be improved shortly.
- Its now possible to edit the track number of a track
- The edit pages now include style guidelines for how to edit the data.
- The CD submission pages have mostly been ported to Mason. The multiple
  artist CD submission pages are not done yet.

Changed for Version 1.0.0pre23
------------------------------

- Lots bug fixes over version 22. See the bug tracking system for more 
  details.
- Added freedb import link to the search box when a search comes up empty.
- Added a 30 day statistics view to the stats page. Based on Johans gnuplot
  stuff. Those flat lines are pretty sad, when you only have data for 6
  days. :-(


Changes for Version 1.0.0pre22
-----------------------------

- Now using Postgres! Along with this we have an improved database schema
  that uses foreign keys, views and transactions. The database should be
  a lot more sane now.
- The ModeratorInfo table is now Moderator, and the Changes table is now
  the Moderations table.
- Full UTF-8 support! 
- Removed the automatic metadata collection stuff -- it wasn't working and
  so I took it out. Plus it didn't fit with the evolving model of having
  humans verify the data in the system.
- Cleaned up some naming issues. GUIDs are now TRMs as they should be.
- Created a ModBot moderator, who enters notes into moderations if they 
  fail.
- The server now keeps track of daily stats. We just need to create a 
  pretty graph that is updated daily.
- MusicBrainz relative links are now allowed in the moderation notes
- The RDF interface now has a more granular depth setting that allows 
  the client to control how much data gets returned from the server.

Changes for Version 1.0.0pre6
-----------------------------

- Added new remove track feature. If this track appears on one album only,
  the track and album reference is removed. If this track appears elsewhere,
  only the album reference is removed.
- Added new remove album features. The remove album link only shows up 
  when an album has no tracks associated with it. When a remove album
  moderation ends in a failed dependecy, this means that the album was 
  not empty when the moderation was applied. (This could happen if someone
  adds a tracks to an album during the album removal phase)
- The TOC table no longer gets duplicate diskid records.
- Multiple artist albums are now marked with Artist id 1 (ModDefs::VARTIST_ID).
  By default, artist table will have an entry of various artists, with id = 1.

Changes for Version 1.0.0pre3
-----------------------------

- New HTML design. Design and many thanks go to Phester (ceo@phester.org)
- The database now allows more arbitrary album <-> track and GUID <--> track
  associations. For this change, the Track table no longer has an Artist or
  GUID fields. Instead, we now have a GUID table to keep track of GUIDs,
  a GUIDJoin table to associate GUIDs with Tracks and an AlbumJoin to
  associate tracks with albums in a nice and flexible manner.
- The Artist table now also has a SortName column that can be used when a list
  of artists is displayed. So name might contain 'The Beatles' and sortname
  should contain 'Beatles, The'.
- The perl modules are broken down into seperate modules, rather than one
  large MusicBrainz.pm.
- The top moderators and server statistics are shown in the sidebar and
  update once an hour.
- The sponsors now have graphics on the page. The actual look of that box
  will be improved shortly.
- Its now possible to edit the track number of a track
- The edit pages now include style guidelines for how to edit the data.
- The CD submission pages have mostly been ported to Mason. The multiple
  artist CD submission pages are not done yet.

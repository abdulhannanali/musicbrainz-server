Changes for Version 1.0.0pre6
-----------------------------

- Added new remove track feature. If this track appears on one album only,
  the track and album reference is removed. If this track appears elsewhere,
  only the album reference is removed.
- Added new remove album features. The remove album link only shows up 
  when an album has no tracks associated with it. When a remove album
  moderation ends in a failed dependecy, this means that the album was 
  not empty when the moderation was applied. (This could happen if someone
  adds a tracks to an album during the album removal phase)
- The TOC table no longer gets duplicate diskid records.
- Multiple artist albums are now marked with Artist id 1 (ModDefs::VARTIST_ID).
  By default, artist table will have an entry of various artists, with id = 1.

Changes for Version 1.0.0pre3
-----------------------------

- New HTML design. Design and many thanks go to Phester (ceo@phester.org)
- The database now allows more arbitrary album <-> track and GUID <--> track
  associations. For this change, the Track table no longer has an Artist or
  GUID fields. Instead, we now have a GUID table to keep track of GUIDs,
  a GUIDJoin table to associate GUIDs with Tracks and an AlbumJoin to
  associate tracks with albums in a nice and flexible manner.
- The Artist table now also has a SortName column that can be used when a list
  of artists is displayed. So name might contain 'The Beatles' and sortname
  should contain 'Beatles, The'.
- The perl modules are broken down into seperate modules, rather than one
  large MusicBrainz.pm.
- The top moderators and server statistics are shown in the sidebar and
  update once an hour.
- The sponsors now have graphics on the page. The actual look of that box
  will be improved shortly.
- Its now possible to edit the track number of a track
- The edit pages now include style guidelines for how to edit the data.
- The CD submission pages have mostly been ported to Mason. The multiple
  artist CD submission pages are not done yet.

TODO
====

The following items are the top features that people have requested. If
you feel like taking on one of the following, please do. I'll integrate
patches back into the distribution source code:

1) Correcting logical (non-typo) errors in the index
2) Mirroring support
3) More support for classical CDs. Composer/performer fields especially.
4) UNICODE support for other character sets.
5) Allowing multiple copies for different languages

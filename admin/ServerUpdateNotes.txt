I Server update tasks
---------------------

1. Rebuild text indexes after David fixed alias remove problem.

	./admin/RebuildArtistWords
	(Takes about twenty minutes on my machine; apart from the fact
	that this script will keep the server quite busy, there's no
	reason to stop the server for this script).

2. For the albummeta optimization changes:

    Execute this cwinfor the shell 

       createlang plpgsql musicbrainz

    Execute the SQL statements in admin/sql/CreateTriggers.sql by:

       psql musicbrainz < CreateTriggers.sql

    Then execute the fill_album_meta function:

       echo "select fill_album_meta();" | psql musicbrainz


II Optimization tasks
---------------------

This query is dead-slow:
# Optimize:
#         SELECT Track.id, Track.name, Artist.id, Artist.name, AlbumJoin.album, 
#               Track.gid, count(WordList.Id), lower(Track.name)
#          FROM Track, TrackWords, WordList, Artist, AlbumJoin
#          WHERE WordList.Word IN ( 'up','it','roll')
#                and TrackWords.Wordid = WordList.Id
#                and TrackWords.Trackid = Track.Id
#                and Track.Artist = Artist.id
#               and AlbumJoin.Track = Track.Id
#          GROUP BY Track.Id, Track.name, Artist.id, Artist.name, AlbumJoin.album, Track.gid
#          HAVING count(WordList.Id) = 3
#          ORDER BY count(WordList.Id) desc, lower(Track.name), Track.name LIMIT 25
# Insert non album tracks

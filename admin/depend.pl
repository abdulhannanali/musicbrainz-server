You are using DBD::Pg version $DBD::Pg::VERSION.  We recommend DBD::Pg version 1.32.

Some people have reported issues with versions of DBD::Pg of 1.40 or later,
especially if they are running a replication slave server.  In each case
those issues were resolved by using DBD::Pg version 1.32.  (After version
1.32, DBD::Pg was taken on by a new maintainer, rewritten, and released as
version 1.40).

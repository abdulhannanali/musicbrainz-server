<p>
    This report lists broken tracks containing featuring artists that don't
    follow the style guide. For some tracks (those with a <em>Suggest</em>
    link) a suggestion exists which is used as a default in the
    <em>edit track</em> dialog. You may still need the <em>Guess Case</em>
    button or manual intervention, however.

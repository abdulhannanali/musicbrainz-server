<h2>Help Wanted</h2>

<p>
MusicBrainz has <a href="/future.html">grand ambitions</a> and already gets tons of support
from the community that has built up around the project. We need all kinds of help: Editing the
data, <a href="/mod/search/pre/new.html">voting on other people's edits</a>, documenting existing software
and testing new features. However, we really need software developers and testers 
to develop the next great MusicBrainz feature. If you think MusicBrainz is cool and you're a 
motivated hacker/tester and hack on software for fun,
<a href="mailto&#x3a;helpwanted&#x0040;musicbrainz.org">please let us know</a>!
</p>

<p>
If you have most, but not all the skills required we'd be willing to help you learn 
the missing skills. We're looking for self motivated people
willing to learn new things and to challenge the status quo.
</p>

<p>
All of our positions have the following benefits:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Undying gratitude of the MusicBrainz community</li>
<li>Your name in <a href="/bio.html">lights</a></li> 
<li>Excellent resume fodder</li>
<li>yourname&#x0040;musicbrainz.org mail address</li>
</ul>

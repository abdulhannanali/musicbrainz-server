<p style="border: 2px dotted red; padding: 1em; margin: 2em">
Please note that the recent creation of the <a href="http://metabrainz.org">MetaBrainz
Foundation</a> does not change <b>any</b> of our licenses. MetaBrainz was founded
on the premise of keeping the data open and available to the public. 
</p>

<p>
The data collected by the MusicBrainz project falls into two categories explained below.
Any user that contributes to MusicBrainz should be aware that their contributions will
be made available to the public under the following licenses:
</p>

<h2>Public Domain Data</h2>

<img style="float: right; margin: 2em;" 
    src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/norights-a.gif"
		alt="No rights reserved: Public Domain"
		style="float: right; margin: 10px;">

<p>
The core data of the MusicBrainz dataset is placed into the <a 
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">Public Domain</a>, 
which means that anyone can download and use the core data in any 
way they see fit. No restictions, no worries!
</p>

<p>
The core data consists of the following pieces of data. The SQL tablenames are shown in parenthesis
after the description of the data:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Artist names and artist alias information (artist, artistalias)</li>
<li>Album names (album, albumjoin)</li>
<li>Track names (track)</li>
<li>CD Identifcation information (album_cdtoc and cdtoc)</li>
<li>TRM Identifiers and related data (trm, trmjoin, clientversion)</li>
<li>Release dates (release, country)</li>
<li>Advanced Relationships (lt_*, l_*, link_attribute, link_attribute_type)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The live data-feed that we offer to replicate the MusicBrainz data is a slight exception
to the rules above, since both Public Domain data and Creative Commons data (see below)
are intermingled in the data update packets. Given that the highest common
license denominator needs to be applied to these data packets, the Creative Commons license
governs the live update data feeds.
</p>

<p>
To get the freely available Public Domain data, please download a data snapshot from
the <a href="/products/server/download.html">download</a> page.
</p>


<h2>Creative Commons Licensed Data</h2>

		style="float: right; margin: 10px;">

<p>
The remaining portions of the MusicBrainz data are released under the Creative Commons <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0</a>
license. This allows non commercial use of the MusicBrainz data as long as MusicBrainz is given credit
and that derivative works (works based on MusicBrainz CC licensed data) are also made available
under the same license. For more information on the Creative Commons and their licenses, please
refer to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> home page.
</p>

<p>
The Creative Commons licensed data portions are: (The SQL tablenames are shown in parenthesis
after the description of the data)
</p>

<ul>
<li>Album metadata tables (album_amazon_asin, albummeta)</li>
<li>Search indexes (wordlist, artistwords, albumwords, trackwords)</li>
<li>Annotations (annotation)</li>
<li>Statistics (currentstat, historicalstat, stats, trmjoin_stat, trm_stat)</li>
<li>Moderations (automod_election, moderation_note_open, moderation_open, moderator, vote_open)</li>
<li>Closed moderations (moderation_closed, moderation_note_closed, vote_closed)</li>
<li>Live data-feed -- see section below</li>
<li>Artist relationships (artist_relation) (data provided by Agent Arts)</li>
</ul>

the <a href="/products/server/download.html">download</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Live data-feed</h2>

<p>
MusicBrainz has been offering its live data-feed since spring 2004. This live data-feed enables a server 
running a PostgreSQL database in conjunction with the MusicBrainz server software to automatically stay
in synch with the main server. A mirror (slave) server downloads replication packets from the main
MusicBrainz FTP site at hourly intervals and applies them to the local database. This enables the mirror
server to never be more than about an hour of sync with the main server.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned above, the replication packets contain both Public Domain and Creative Commons licensed
data. The Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0</a>
license allows anyone in a non-commercial setting to use this live data feed. However, if you would
like to use this live-data feed in a commerical setting, you will need to obtain a commercial
data license from the MetaBrainz Foundation. For information on what entails commercial use and how
to obtain a commercial use license for the live data feed, please visit the <a 
href="http://metabrainz.org/about/license.html">MetaBrainz data license page</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Please note that MusicBrainz is <b>not</b> charging for access to the data!</b> Anyone can
download the data snapshots that are at most a few days old (which is better than our closest
competitors) or use our web service to access the data <b>now</b>. 
We are charging for <b>timely and convenient access</b> to the data for commercial users so
that we can fund the operation of the non-profit foundation and in turn develop new features.

<p>
The data collected by the MusicBrainz project falls into two categories explained below.
Any user that contributes to MusicBrainz should be aware that their contributions will
be made available to the public under the following licenses:
</p>

<h2>Public Domain Data</h2>

<p>
The core data of the MusicBrainz dataset is placed into the <a 
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">Public Domain</a>, 
which means that anyone can download and use the core data in any 
way they see fit. No restictions, no worries!
</p>

<p>
The core data consists of the following pieces of data. The SQL tablenames are shown in parenthesis
after the description of the data:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Artist names and artist alias information (artist, artistalias)</li>
<li>Album names (album, albumjoin)</li>
<li>Track names (track)</li>
<li>CD Identifcation information (album_cdtoc and cdtoc)</li>
<li>TRM Identifiers and related data (trm, trmjoin, clientversion)</li>
<li>Release dates (release, country)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The live data-feed that we offer to replicate the MusicBrainz data is a slight exception
to the rules above, since both Public Domain data and Creative Commons data (see below)
are intermingled in the data update packets. Given that the highest common
license denominator needs to be applied to these data packets, the Creative Commons license
governs the live update data feeds.

    Robert is a die hard MP3 fan dedicated to improving the digital audio
    experience. After studying Computer Engineering at 
    <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu">Cal Poly</a> he joined 
    <a href="http://www.xingtech.com">Xing Technology</a> where he
    was part of the MP3 team and served as the development manager
    for the AudioCatalyst project. While at EMusic, Robert has been working 
    on the 
    <a href="http://www.freeamp.org">FreeAmp</a> and 
    <a href="http://obs.freeamp.org">Obsequeiuem</a> projects, besides
    working on MusicBrainz. Robert is now working for 
    <a href="http://www.bitzi.com">Bitzi</a> who is now also a sponsor of
    MusicBrainz.

    <p>
    Robert is a complete OpenSource, Linux, Perl, Honda S2000 and 
    <a href="http://www.burningman.com">Burning Man</a> nut. Generally
    considered to be an all around troublemaker, its probably best to
    keep a safe distance from Robert at all times.

		After a BSc in mathematics at
		<a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/">Southampton&nbsp;University</a>,
		David first worked for
		<a href="http://www.watford.co.uk/">Watford&nbsp;Electronics</a>
		for a year before moving on to
		<a href="http://www.csc.com/"><abbr title="Computer Sciences Corporation">CSC</abbr></a>,
		where he coded in C against Ingres, Informix and Oracle
		databases.&nbsp;
		After three years there, David went to work for
		Transatlantic Software, where he
		gained experience in
		SQL Server and UNIX before working on
		database-driven web sites written in Perl.&nbsp;
		Since December 2000 David has worked for
		<a href="http://powernet.co.uk/">Power&nbsp;Internet</a>
		where he specialises in implementing web sites
		using
		<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>
		and
		<a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a>
		on
		<a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After finding MusicBrainz in July 2002 (and then promptly losing
		it again until October), David now does most of the MusicBrainz
		server programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although somewhat rusty through lack of practice, David
		can still play the violin.&nbsp; Just about.

		Tarragon is our "Style Dude", which means that whenever we wonder

	</p>
	<p>
		"I work as a systems administrator and network engineer for a small ISP called 
		OnTheNet based in Melbourne, Australia, and I also provide those services to 
		another company called InfoXchange Australia which is a not-for-profit 
		company that provides computer services for the community sector in 
		Australia.
	</p>

	<p>
		"I found MusicBrainz while I was looking for some way to automatically sort and 
		tag my rather large music collection, and became involved in the community as 
		it seemed to be fairly open and catered to my ideal of what a music database 
		should be about."

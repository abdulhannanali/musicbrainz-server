		After a BSc in mathematics at
		<a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/">Southampton&nbsp;University</a>,
		David first worked for
		<a href="http://www.watford.co.uk/">Watford&nbsp;Electronics</a>
		for a year before moving on to
		<a href="http://www.csc.com/"><abbr title="Computer Sciences Corporation">CSC</abbr></a>,
		where he coded in C against Ingres, Informix and Oracle
		databases.&nbsp;
		After three years there, David went to work for
		Transatlantic Software, where he
		gained experience in
		SQL Server and UNIX before working on
		database-driven web sites written in Perl.&nbsp;
		Since December 2000 David has worked for
		<a href="http://powernet.co.uk/">Power&nbsp;Internet</a>
		where he specialises in implementing web sites
		using
		<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>
		and
		<a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a>
		on
		<a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After finding MusicBrainz in July 2002 (and then promptly losing
		it again until October), David now does most of the MusicBrainz
		server programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although somewhat rusty through lack of practice, David
		can still play the violin.&nbsp; Just about.

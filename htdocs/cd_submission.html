Before explaining the Audio CD-ROM submission process for MusicBrainz, some
background on Audio CD-ROMs is necessary. Below is a quick, fairly 
non-technical introduction to Audio CD-ROMs. If you want <b>lots</b> more
detail about CD-ROMs and how CD Index Ids are calculated, you should
take a look at the <a href="/disc.html">CD Index Ids</a> document.

<p>
An audio CD-ROM does not contain
any metadata, like its title, the artist or the track names. There are some
newer variants of audio CD-ROMs with CD-TEXT extensions that do contain
metadata, but they are not in wide use. So, you need a system like MusicBrainz
to identify a CD-ROM and to provide the metadata for that CD-ROM.

<p>
An Audio CD-ROM contains a table of contents (TOC) that indicates where 
each of the tracks on the CD starts. After the TOC, the audio tracks start,
each at a given sector offset, as outlined in the TOC. The CD-ROM is logically
broken into sectors, where each sector represents 1/75th of a second of sound. 
So, 75 sectors on a CD equate to 1 second of sound.

<p>
The CD Index ID is calculated from the table of contents, and nothing else.
So, if one CD differs from another CD by as little as one single track being 
longer/shorter by one sector, the CD Index ID will be completely different.
This ensures that each type of CD has a unique identifier, which is important
for looking up metadata for CDs.

<p>
However, there is a downside to this as well. Audio CD-ROMs are usually
produced in large batches, that may include thousands if not millions of copies
of one CD. Once a record company is done selling that one batch, or a 
record company in another country wants to print up a batch of the same
CD, they will make another batch. There are over 10 different pressings
for the album 'The Dark Side of the Moon' by Pink Floyd, for instance.

<p>
If the CDs from the new batch are off by one sector (as mentioned above)
they will have a different unique CD Index ID. Let's assume that a CD from
a new batch has one track that is shorter by one sector (as compared to
the previous batch). This yields a different CD Index ID, but to the human
ear the CD will be identical, since humans cannot tell that one track 
is shorter by 1/75th of a second.

<& /comp/section, title=>'Inserting Audio CD-ROMs into MusicBrainz' &>

Now to explain the MusicBrainz CD insertion process. Let's say you use one of
the <a href="/download.html">CD Submission tools</a> to submit a CD and you
find that MusicBrainz doesn't know about the CD. You then proceed to
select the artist and then MusicBrainz shows you a list of CDs and your CD
is right there is in the list. What's wrong?

<p>
There may be a few things going on:
<ul>
<li>MusicBrainz may not have any CD Index IDs for this album.
<li>MusicBrainz may have a different CD Index ID than you have, thus
    MusicBrainz already knows about a different pressing of the CD.
</ul>

<p>
In either case, you should select the matching CD and let MusicBrainz create
another <b>association</b> for you. This means that MusicBrainz will now know 
about the new CD Index ID that you just reported. The next time you 
want to look up this CD, MusicBrainz will gladly deliver the data to you.

<p>
However, that's not all. Let's say that the CD you're looking for is not found.
In that case, you should select 'CD not found' and then proceed to enter the
data for that CD, so it can be included in the MusicBrainz database. And, there
may be yet another case, where MusicBrainz knows about your CD, but it has a
different number of tracks than your CD.

<p>
This happens when two different pressings of a CD have a different number of 
tracks. Let's say that a band in the UK releases a CD that contains 10 tracks
and one bonus track for a total of 11 tracks. Once the CD is released in
the US, the US record company may decide for some reason to yank the bonus
track and issue the CD under the exact same name as the CD released in the UK.
As far as MusicBrainz is concerned, they are two completely different CDs,
and MusicBrainz should have a record for both of these CDs. So, if you run
into this problem, please proceed with entering the data for your CD, even
though MusicBrainz already has one version of it.

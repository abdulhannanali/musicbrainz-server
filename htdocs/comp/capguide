<b>Capitalization Guide for Submitting/Editing Data</b>

<p>

Use the following standard guidelines for capitalizing titles (albums,
songs) in the English language. (Other rules may apply to other languages.)
All titles should be in standard mixed case (initial caps and following
lower case), as noted below:

<ol>
<li>Always capitalize the first and last word of a title. If a title
    is broken up by major punctuation (colon, question mark, exclamation
    mark, em-dash, parentheses, or quotes), treat each distinct piece
    of the title as a whole, and always capitalize the first and last
    words of each division.
<li>Capitalize all words between the first and last word of a title except:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Articles: <b>a</b>, <b>an</b>, <b>the</b>
    <li>Coordinate conjunctions: <b>and</b>, <b>but</b>, <b>or</b>, <b>nor</b>
    <li>Short (three letters or less) prepositions: <b>as</b>, <b>at</b>, <b>by</b>, 
       <b>for</b>, <b>in</b>, <b>of</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>to</b> -- except when used as abverbs or as an inseparable
       part of a verb
    <li>When used to form an infinitive: <b>to</b>
    </ol>
<li>In compounds formed by hyphens, capitalize each part except where
    the part would not be capitalized if it were a separate word.

<li>Only use all caps for acronyms or abbreviations where common use
    is all caps.

<li>Capitalize contractions and slang consistent with the rules above
    to the extent that such clearly apply. For example, do not capitalize
    <b>o</b>' for "<b>of</b>", '<b>n</b>' or <b>n</b>' for "<b>and</b>".
</ol>

<strong>Can't find what you're looking for?</strong><p/>
If you can't find what you're looking for, it's possible that <strong>your search terms didn't match our data</strong>. Try the following:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Modify your search terms in the box below</strong> and search again.<br/>
Often it helps to remove information such as words that might be misspelled, remix names, featured artists, etc.<br/>
Your tags may differ considerably from the data in MusicBrainz, as we edit data according to our <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/OfficialStyleGuideline">Style Guidelines</a>, so less specific searches may find what you are looking for. This is especially true if your tags are inaccurate. There are more searching hints on the <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/HowToSearch">How to Search</a> page on the wiki.</li>
% if (defined $artistobj) {
	<li><strong>Look for the album on the <a href="/showartist.html?id=<% $artistobj->GetId() %>">artist page for <% $artist %></a></strong>. You may find that the album you're looking for is on the artist's page even if the search doesn't find it.</li>
% } else {
	<li><strong>Search for the artist and look for the album on the artist page</strong>. You may find that the album you're looking for is on the artist's page even if the search doesn't find it.</li>
% }
    <li><strong>Search for just the artist, album or track using the quick search in the sidebar</strong>. The quick search only tries to match one piece of data, and you're therefore more likely to find what you're looking for.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What if I still can't find what I'm looking for?</strong><p/>
If you've tried all of the above and still can't find what you're looking for, maybe MusicBrainz just doesn't have the information in the database. You can:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="/freedb/freedb.html?search=<% uri_escape($search) %>">Import a new album from FreeDB</a></strong>. You will need to spend some time cleaning up the data according to the <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/OfficialStyleGuideline">Style Guidelines</a>, finding release dates, etc. before it gets inserted into MusicBrainz.
</li>
% if (defined $artistobj) {
	<li><strong><a href="/edit/album/add.html?artistid=<% $artistobj->GetId %>">Add an album manually</a></strong>.</li>
% } else {
	<li><strong><a href="http://musicbrainz.org/edit/artist/add.html?initial_name=<% $artist %>">Add a new artist</a></strong>.</li>
% }
% if ($artist ne '' && defined $artistobj) {
	<li>If you can't find the track you're looking for and you are <em>sure</em> that the track has never been released on any album or single (including bootlegs), you can <a href="/edit/track/addnonalbum.html?artistid=<% $artistobj->GetId %>" onclick="document.forms.AddNonAlbumTrack.submit(); return false">add a non-album track</a> to the artist '<% $artist %>'. Do <strong>not</strong> use this simply because you can't find which album a track is on (or haven't looked), or your changes will be voted down.</li>
% }
</ul>

<form method="post" action="/edit/track/addnonalbum.html" id="AddNonAlbumTrack">
	<input type="hidden" name="artistid" value="<% $artistobj ? $artistobj->GetId : '' %>"/>

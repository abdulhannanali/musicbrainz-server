        The users make MusicBrainz happen and we appreciate your help!
        </p>
        <p>
        However, we still have to pay the bills and hosting this site costs nearly $1000/month. We need
        our users to help us make ends meet and hopefully have money left over to sponsor
        more development. The <a href="http://metabrainz.org">MetaBrainz Foundation</a>, 
        a California based 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit,
        operates the MusicBrainz project which makes all donations <b>tax deductible</b> for US taxpayers.
        And its simply good karma everywhere else!
        </p>
        <p>
        If you donate <b>$4</b> you will not get this nag text for a <b>month</b>. We encourage people to
        donate $12 to make the nag screen disappear for 3 months. Or even better, sign up for a recurring
        donation every three months to not have to think about or see this nag again. 
        </p>

<b>General Style Guidelines</b>

<p>
<ol>
<li> Use a colon (<b>:</b>) to separate parts of a title. Take an example
     from Etta James:

   <blockquote>
   <b>Tell Mama: The Complete Muscle Shoals Sessions</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When a CD is part of a multiple CD volume,
  indicate the disc number as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Wall (disc 1)</b>
   </blockquote>

  If each CD has a name as well, the disc name should be
  included as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness
     (disc 2: Twilight to Starlight)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> If some copies of a release are accompanied by a
  "bonus" disc, the bonus disc's name should follow
  one of the following examples:
   <p>
   <b>
   <ul>
   <li>Mother Nature Calls (bonus disc)
   <li>Greatest Hits (bonus disc: Acoustic Hits)
   </ul>
   </b>

<li> For CD Box sets that contain more than one
  multiple CD volume, indicate the name of
  the box set in the title of the release 
  as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Later Years (disc 2)</b>
   </blockquote>

  If the individual boxes are not named, then
  indicate the box and disc as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Led Zeppelin Box Set (box 2, disc 3)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When two artists collaborate on a track or
  release, file the track/release under the primary
  artist, and then append the name of the
  secondary artist to the name of the track/release
  as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>Put Your Lights On (feat. Everlast)</b>
   </blockquote>

  If neither artist can be considered secondary,
  choose either artist.
<p>
<li> When work from two artists are remixed in the 
  popular <b>vs.</b> fashion, file the release/track
  under the mix artist and title the release/track
  as follows:
   
   <blockquote>
   <b>ATB vs. Faithless</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> Some audio CDs contain extra data tracks. Enter
  <b>[data track]</b> as the name for these tracks.
  Note, however, that if the data track comes last
  on the CD and isn't visible in an audio CD player,
  the track shouldn't be entered into MusicBrainz.
<p>
<li> Some CDs contain silent tracks. Enter
  <b>[silence]</b> as the name for these tracks.
<p>
<li> Some CDs contain unnamed tracks. Enter
  <b>[untitled]</b> as the name for these tracks.
<p>
<li> Tracks or releases whose artist is unknown should be
  filed under the <b>[unknown]</b> artist.
<p>
<li> It is currently not possible to store all
  information about releases that people might be
  interested in. Rather than clutter release/track
  titles with too much information, the following
  details should be left out:
   <p>
   <ul>
   <li> Disc numbers of CD singles.
   <li> Country of release or designation as an import.
   <li> Record label.
   <li> Designation as a "bonus track".
   <li> Any other information not discussed in this guide.
   </ul>
<p>
<li> Mix names and other track attributes should be
  entered in parenthesis after the title. These
  attributes should be in lower case, except for
  proper names (including titles given to mixes):
   <p>
   <b>
   <ul>
   <li> Blue (extended mix)
   <li> Talking All That Jazz (Torti's Old School Mix of Edits dub)
   <li> Bear Witness (Automator's 2 Turntables and a Razor Blade re-edit)
   <li> Disciple (demo)
   </ul>
   </b>

<li> If a live bootleg release has no proper title, you
  should follow the format used in these examples:
   <p>
   <b>
   <ul>
   <li> 2000-10-22: Las Vegas, NV, USA
   <li> 2000-06-01: Dublin, Ireland (disc 2)
   <li> Milan, Italy (disc 1)
   </ul>
   </b>

<li> If two releases are re-released on one CD, or if
  two songs share the same track, the title should be
  split as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>This Is the Modern World / All Mod Cons</b>
   </blockquote>

<li>  If the letters <b>EP</b> are part of an EP's
  title, they should not be removed. Eg. <b>The
  Sunrise EP</b> by Cause and Effect.
<p>
<li> A soundtrack should be given the same title as
  the film (or other production) it is from.
<p>
<li> Tracks or releases without an artist should
  be filed under <b>[no artist]</b>. This would be
  appropriate for silence on a VA release, bird
  song etc.

</ol>

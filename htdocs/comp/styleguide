<b>General Style Guidelines</b>

<p>
<ol>
<li> Use a colon <b>:</b> to separate parts of a title. Take an example
     from Etta James:

   <blockquote>
   <b>Tell Mama: The Complete Muscle Shoals Sessions</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When a CD is part of a multiple CD volume,
  indicate the disc number as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Wall (disc 1)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> For CD Box sets that contain more than one
  multiple CD volume, indicate the name of
  the box set in the title of the album 
  as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Later Years (disc 2)</b>
   </blockquote>

  If the individual boxes are not named, then
  indicate the box and disc as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Led Zeppelin Box Set (box 2, disc 3)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When two artists collaborate on an album, file
  the album under the primary artist, and then
  append the name of the secondary artist to the
  name of the album as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Green Album (feat. Kate Bush)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When two artists collaborate one one track,
  add the guest artists to the track name as
  follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>Put Your Lights On (feat. Everlast)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When work from two artists are remixed in the 
  popular <b>vs.</b> fashion, file the album/track
  under the mix artist and title the album/track
  as follows:
   
   <blockquote>
   <b>ATB vs. Faithless</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> Some Audio CDs contain extra data tracks. Enter
  <b>[data track]</b> as the name for these tracks.
</ol>

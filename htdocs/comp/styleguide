<p><b>General Style Guidelines</b></p>

<ol class="StyleGuideList">

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "sep-with-colon" &>
		Use a colon (<b>:</b>) to separate parts of a title. Take an example
		from Etta James:
		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
		 	<b>Tell Mama: The Complete Muscle Shoals Sessions</b>
		</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "disc-n" &>
		When a CD is part of a multiple CD volume,
		indicate the disc number as follows:

		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
			<b>The Wall (disc 1)</b>
		</blockquote>

		<& .StyleGuideLink, "disc-n-with-name" &>
		If each CD has a name as well, the disc name should be
		included as follows:

		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
			<b>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (disc 2: Twilight to Starlight)</b>
		</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "bonus-disc" &>
		If some copies of a release are accompanied by a
		"bonus" disc, the bonus disc's name should follow
		one of the following examples:
		
		<ul class="StyleExample">
			<li>Mother Nature Calls (bonus disc)</li>
			<li>Greatest Hits (bonus disc: Acoustic Hits)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "box-set-name" &>
		For CD Box sets that contain more than one
		multiple CD volume, indicate the name of
		the box set in the title of the release 
		as follows:

		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
			<b>The Later Years (disc 2)</b>
		</blockquote>

		<& .StyleGuideLink, "box-set-name-disc-n" &>
		If the individual boxes are not named, then
		indicate the box and disc as follows:

		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
			<b>The Led Zeppelin Box Set (box 2, disc 3)</b>
		</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "feat-artist" &>
		When two artists collaborate on a track or
		release, file the track/release under the primary
		artist, and then append the name of the
		secondary artist to the name of the track/release
		as follows:

		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
			<b>Put Your Lights On (feat. Everlast)</b>
		</blockquote>

		If neither artist can be considered secondary,
		choose either artist.
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "remix-versus" &>
		When work from two artists are remixed in the 
		popular <b>vs.</b> fashion, file the release/track
		under the mix artist and title the release/track
		as follows:
   
		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
			<b>ATB vs. Faithless</b>
		</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "data-track" &>
		Some audio CDs contain extra data tracks. Enter
		<b>[data&nbsp;track]</b> as the name for these tracks.
		Note, however, that if the data track comes last
		on the CD and isn't visible in an audio CD player,
		the track shouldn't be entered into MusicBrainz.
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "silence-track" &>
		Some CDs contain silent tracks. Enter
		<b>[silence]</b> as the name for these tracks.
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "untitled-track" &>
		Some CDs contain unnamed tracks. Enter
		<b>[untitled]</b> as the name for these tracks.
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "unknown-artist" &>
		Tracks or releases whose artist is unknown should be
		filed under the <b>[unknown]</b> artist.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "information-to-omit" &>
		It is currently not possible to store all
		information about releases that people might be
		interested in. Rather than clutter release/track
		titles with too much information, the following
		details should be left out:

		<ul>
		 	<li>Disc numbers of CD singles</li>
			<li>Country of release or designation as an import</li>
			<li>Record label</li>
			<li>Designation as a "bonus track"</li>
			<li>Any other information not discussed in this guide.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "track-attributes" &>
		Mix names and other track attributes should be
		entered in parentheses after the title. These
		attributes should be in lower case, except for
		proper names (including titles given to mixes):
		
		<ul class="StyleExample">
			<li>Blue (extended mix)</li>
			<li>Talking All That Jazz (Torti's Old School Mix of Edits dub)</li>
			<li>Bear Witness (Automator's 2 Turntables and a Razor Blade re-edit)</li>
			<li>Disciple (demo)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "unnamed-bootlegs" &>
		If a live bootleg release has no proper title, you
		should follow the format used in these examples:
		
		<ul class="StyleExample">
			<li>2000-10-22: Las Vegas, NV, USA</li>
			<li>2000-06-01: Dublin, Ireland (disc 2)</li>
			<li>Milan, Italy (disc 1)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "multiple-names" &>
		If two releases are re-released on one CD, or if
		two songs share the same track, the title should be
		split as follows:

		<blockquote class="StyleExample">
			<b>This Is the Modern World / All Mod Cons</b>
		</blockquote>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "keep-EP" &>
		If the letters <b>EP</b> are part of an EP's
		title, they should not be removed. Eg.
		<b>The Sunrise EP</b> by Cause and Effect.
	</li>

	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "soundtrack-name" &>
		A soundtrack should be given the same title as
		the film (or other production) it is from.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<& .StyleGuideLink, "no-artist" &>
		Tracks or releases without an artist should
		be filed under <b>[no&nbsp;artist]</b>. This would be
		appropriate for silence on a VA release, bird
		song etc.
	</li>

</ol>

<b>General Style Guidelines</b>

<p>
<ol>
<li> Use a colon <b>:</b> to separate parts of a title. Take an example
     from Etta James:

   <blockquote>
   <b>Tell Mama: The Complete Muscle Shoals Sessions</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When a CD is part of a multiple CD volume,
  indicate the disc number as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Wall (disc 1)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> For CD Box sets that contain more than one
  multiple CD volume, indicate the name of
  the box set in the title of the album 
  as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Later Years (disc 2)</b>
   </blockquote>

  If the individual boxes are not named, then
  indicate the box and disc as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>The Led Zeppelin Box Set (box 2, disc 3)</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> When two artists collaborate on a track or
  album, file the track/album under the primary
  artist, and then append the name of the
  secondary artist to the name of the track/album
  as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>Put Your Lights On (feat. Everlast)</b>
   </blockquote>

  If neither artist can be considered secondary,
  choose either artist.
<p>
<li> When work from two artists are remixed in the 
  popular <b>vs.</b> fashion, file the album/track
  under the mix artist and title the album/track
  as follows:
   
   <blockquote>
   <b>ATB vs. Faithless</b>
   </blockquote>

<li> Some audio CDs contain extra data tracks. Enter
  <b>[data track]</b> as the name for these tracks.
<p>
<li> Some CDs contain silent tracks. Enter
  <b>[silence]</b> as the name for these tracks.
<p>
<li> Some CDs contain unnamed tracks. Enter
  <b>[untitled]</b> as the name for these tracks.
<p>
<li> Tracks or CDs whose artist is unknown should be
  filed under the <b>[unknown]</b> artist.
<p>
<li> It is currently not possible to store all
  information about releases that people might be
  interested in. Rather than clutter release titles
  with too much information, the following details
  should be left out:
   <p>
   <ul>
   <li> Disc numbers of CD singles
   <li> Country of origin/import status
   <li> Record label
   </ul>
<p>
<li> Mix names and other track attributes should be
  entered in parenthesis after the title. These
  attributes should be in lower case, except for
  proper names (including titles given to mixes):
   <p>
   <b>
   <ul>
   <li> Blue (extended mix)
   <li> Talking All That Jazz (Torti's Old School Mix of Edits dub)
   <li> Bear Witness (Automator's 2 Turntables and a Razor Blade re-edit)
   <li> Disciple (demo)
   </ul>
   </b>

<li> If a live bootleg release has no proper title, you
  should follow the format used in these examples:
   <p>
   <b>
   <ul>
   <li> 2000-10-22: Las Vegas, NV, USA
   <li> 2000-06-01: Dublin, Ireland (disc 2)
   <li> Milan, Italy (disc 1)
   </ul>
   </b>

<li> If two albums are re-released on one CD, or if
  two songs share the same track, the title should be
  split as follows:

   <blockquote>
   <b>This Is the Modern World/All Mod Cons</b>
   </blockquote>

</ol>

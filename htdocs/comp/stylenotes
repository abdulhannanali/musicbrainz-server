<& /comp/tablebegin, title=>'Style Notes for Submitting/Editing Database Entries' &>

Please use the following guidelines for editing data in MusicBrainz. 
This style guideline is designed to get the data in the database as
consistent as possible.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Use mixed case names as you would in titles for an essay. <b>Do not</b> use 'PORTISHEAD'. Use 'Portishead'.
<li>Do not capitalize words like: is, of, a, the, etc.
<li>Type in the field values <b>exactly</b> as shown on the source CD or
    artist web page. 
<li>Be aware and careful of punctuation. If the artist name is listed as 
    <b>M.C. Hawking</b> with the periods, please type in the periods after 
    the M and the C as well. Conversely, do not add extra punctuation.

</ul>

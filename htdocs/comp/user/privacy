				<b>What your e-mail address <i>will</i> be used for:</b>
				Since some users have unfortunately made lots of questionable edits
				 and could not be contacted to fix their
				mistakes, we now require a confirmed (i.e. working) e-mail address for all
				edits made to the database.

				<ul>
					<li>
						When you enter your e-mail address, other editors
						will be able to send messages to you (likewise, you
						will be able to send messages to them).
					</li>
					<li>
						Any notes attached to your edits will
						be e-mailed to you. This enables you to remove,
						correct or clarify edits which will otherwise be
						rejected.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may choose to "subscribe" (for free) to your
						favourite artists, in which case MusicBrainz will send you a daily list of
						edits made to the artists you have subscribed to.
					</li>
					<li>
						In all cases your e-mail address will not be
						revealed to other MusicBrainz users &mdash; they'll
						only see your user name.
					</li>

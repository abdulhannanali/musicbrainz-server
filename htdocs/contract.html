<& /comp/sidebar,  title=>'The MusicBrainz social contract', expand=>'documentation' &>


MusicBrainz, the producers of the MusicBrainz music encyclopedia have created the MusicBrainz social contract. The contract contains our commitments that we shall uphold. The GPL, LGPL, and OpenContent licenses contain the description in legal terms for our defense against violations against our 'copyleft' beliefs. This social contract contains the spirit behind these licenses, written to be readable and understandable.

<a name="1.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'1. MusicBrainz will remain 100% free' &>  
</a>

MusicBrainz consists of three main parts. The development process will be open to the public by using public mailing lists and meetings open to interested parties. The client and server software will remain free, we will never make MusicBrainz depend on non-free software. The Debian free software guidelines will be used to define free software. The database content will be copyleft when possible.

<a name="2.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'2. We will give back to the web and Free software community' &>  
</a>

When we add extensions to MusicBrainz we will license them as free software or content. We will make the best system we can, so that our free encyclopedia will be widely distributed and used. We will feed back bug-fixes, improvements, user requests, etc. using public mailing lists or open meetings.

<a name="3.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'3. We won\'t hide problems and policies' &>
</a>

We will keep all MusicBrainz related discussions open for public view at all times, regardless of their content. All problems and policies related to MusicBrainz will be visible to all.

<a name="4.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'4. Our priorities are our users, free content, and free software' &>
</a>

We will be guided by the needs of our users, free content and software community. We will place their interests first in our priorities. We won't object to commercial use of our copyleft content, companies can use the work of our volunteers without any charge, but charging for the copyleft content itself is forbidden. We aim to follow the GPL in that "You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee."

<a name="5.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'5. Unprotected factual content' &>
</a>

The MusicBrainz content consists only of data submitted by our volunteers. The content is divided into factual and non-factual content and marked as such. Factual content cannot be protected under current US copyright law. This means the copyleft license cannot be enforced and companies can use this content as they please. We hope that the factual artist/track/album content of the music encyclopedia will be as widely distributed and used as possible. Creating derived works from this content is allowed and appreciated. However we may copy unprotected factual extension within derived works back into MusicBrainz if they are published.

<a name="6.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'6. Protected non-factual content' &>
</a>

We aim to extend MusicBrainz with non-factual creative content such as artist biographies. This non-factual content is protected by international copyright laws and placed under the OpenContent license, thus copyleft. Companies can use this non-factual content for web sites or other publications. When creating and publishing derived works of the non-factual content, the copyleft license must be respected. Modifications of the MusicBrainz copyleft content must be given back to the community.

<a name="7.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'7. Derived works for project that don\'t meet our copyleft standards' &>
</a>

A very large portion of the MusicBrainz encyclopedia is factual and uncopyrightable, we place no restriction on derived works of this content. As said before we do not agree with people or companies creating non-free derived works of our non-factual data and re-publishing them. The MusicBrainz non-factual copyleft content cannot be inserted into a non-free database and re-published, indexed against non-free content that is re-published, and may not be mixed with a non-free database on a public web page.

<a name="8.">
<& /comp/section, title=>'8. No warranty or liability for errors' &>
</a>

There is no warrenty for the content of the MusicBrainz database or the software. It is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind for correctness or completeness.

<& /comp/section, title=>'5. MusicBrainz is interested in all types of music' &>

MusicBrainz aims to collect information about <b>all</b> types of music. Published/unpublished, popular/fringe,
western/non-western and human/non-human music should all be entered into MusicBrainz. MusicBrainz does not
discriminate on sex, religion, race or controversial viewpoints. Musicbrainz does not prefer one type
of music over another, which also means that MusicBrainz does not condemm or condone any of the music 
catalogued in the database. Editors and voters are expected to tolerate viewpoints that may differ from
their own.

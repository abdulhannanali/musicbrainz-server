<p>
There are a number of ways that you can contribute to the MusicBrainz
project. You may contribute data, moderation effort, money, source code,
documentation or testing effort:

<& /comp/section, title=>'Contribute Data' &>
<p>

There are several ways that you can contribute data to MusicBrainz:
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="/download.html">CDLookup tool</a>
    for Windows. Pop an Audio CD into your CD-ROM drive, click the
    lookup button and the program will open the mini-browser to
    the MusicBrainz CD Lookup/Submission pages. Just follow the
    instructions from there.
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.freeamp.org">FreeAmp</a> audio 
    player and run your MP3 collection through the signature/metadata
    contribution process. The metadata from you MP3 files will then
    be sent to MusicBrainz.
<li>Use the web interface to add artists, albums and tracks. Start
    <a href="/addartist.html">here</a> to add a new artist, or
    use the <a href="/search.html">search page</a> go to an artist page.
    From the artist page you can click on the <font class="bold">Add Album</font>
    or <font class="bold">Add Track</font> links to start contributing.
</ul>

<& /comp/section, title=>'Maintain the Existing Data' &>
<p>

To maintain the existing data, use the <a href="/search.html">search page</a> 
to log in as a moderator and view the metadata collection. If you spot mistakes,
missing data, or too much data in the database, then please use the 
<font class="bold">Edit</font>, <font class="bold">Delete</font> and
<font class="bold">Merge</font> links on the artist/album pages.

<p>
Each change that you make to the database gets entered into the MusicBrainz
moderation system. The other MusicBrainz users will then have the opportunity
to vote on your changes to make sure that they are correct and they
meet our style guidelines. Check out our detailed 
<a href="/mod_intro.html">moderation introduction</a> for more information
on the moderation system, or go straight to the 
<a href="/moderate.html">moderation pages</a>.

<p>

<& /comp/section, title=>'Contribute Money' &>
<p>

If you feel that MusicBrainz is a worthwhile effort, please consider 
contributing some money. The money will be used to buy awards for
the most prolific contributors to MusicBrainz, and if we can save enough
money it would be nice to form a non-profit tax-exempt corporation. 

<p>
So far, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly and Associates</a> has
already contributed $500 to MusicBrainz. (In return I need to shave
the P2P logo into my hair for the fall P2P conference).

<p>
To send money, please head to over to <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>
and send money to <font class="bold">donations@musicbrainz.org</font>. 
Also, check out our current <a href="/finances.html">finances</a>.

<& /comp/section, title=>'Contribute Source Code/Testing/Documentation' &>
<p>

Last, but certainly not least, you may also contribute your software engineering
efforts in order to advance the MusicBrainz technology. MusicBrainz
is dedicated to the Open Source software development model, and thus
the server and client library are available under the GPL and LGPL,
respectively.

<p>
If you're a programmer, please help out and write some code. Even if you
are not a programmer you can help to advance MusicBrainz -- we will always
need people to help test new features and write documentation for the
things we've already created. To jump in, join the MusicBrainz
<a href="/list.html">mailing list</a>.

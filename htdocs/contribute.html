contributing some money.

<& /comp/section, title=>'Contribute Data' &>
<p>

There are several ways that you can contribute data to MusicBrainz:
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="/tagger/download.html">MusicBrainz Tagger</a>
    and use it to identify and clean up your MP3, WAV and Ogg Vorbis collection.
    The Tagger will attempt to automatically identify your files and walk you
    through the process of matching up the unidentified files. Please note that the
    tagger can also submit audio CD metadata, just like the CDLookup tool mentioned
    below.
<li>Download the <a href="/products/cdlookup/download.html">CDLookup tool</a>
    for Windows. Pop an Audio CD into your CD-ROM drive, click the
    lookup button and the program will open the mini-browser to
    the MusicBrainz CD Lookup/Submission pages. Just follow the
    instructions from there.
<li>Use the web interface to add artists, albums and tracks. Start
    <a href="/addartist.html">here</a> to add a new artist, or
    use the <a href="/search.html">search page</a> go to an artist page.
    From the artist page you can click on the <font class="bold">Add Album</font>
    or <font class="bold">Add Track</font> links to start contributing.
</ul>

<& /comp/section, title=>'Maintain the Existing Data' &>
<p>

To maintain the existing data, use the <a href="/search.html">search page</a> 
to log in as a moderator and view the metadata collection. If you spot mistakes,
missing data, or too much data in the database, then please use the 
<font class="bold">Edit</font>, <font class="bold">Delete</font> and
<font class="bold">Merge</font> links on the artist/album pages.

<p>
Each change that you make to the database gets entered into the MusicBrainz
moderation system. The other MusicBrainz users will then have the opportunity
to vote on your changes to make sure that they are correct and they
meet our style guidelines. Check out our detailed 
<a href="/mod_intro.html">moderation introduction</a> for more information
on the moderation system, or go straight to the 
<a href="/mod/search/pre/new.html">moderation pages</a>.

<p>


<& /comp/section, title=>'Contribute Source Code/Testing/Documentation' &>
<p>

Last, but certainly not least, you may also contribute your software engineering
efforts in order to advance the MusicBrainz technology. MusicBrainz
is dedicated to the Open Source software development model, and thus
the server and client library are available under the GPL and LGPL,
respectively.

<p>
If you're a programmer, please help out and write some code. Even if you
are not a programmer you can help to advance MusicBrainz -- we will always
need people to help test new features and write documentation for the
things we've already created. To jump in, join the MusicBrainz
<a href="/list.html">mailing list</a>.

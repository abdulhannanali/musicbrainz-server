<p>
We used to attempt to document the database structure of the MusicBrainz Server,
but we implement features at a rapid pace and the documentation never seems to
keep up with our changes. In the future we hope to change that, but for now
we invite you to take a look at our
<a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/mb_server/admin/sql/CreateTables.sql?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">CreateTables.sql</a>
script in CVS for a definitive
guide to the database structure of MusicBrainz. This sql script
defines the database structure currently in use on the main server and is
religously kept up to date.
</p>

<p>
The other scripts in the <a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/mb_server/admin/sql/">mb_server/admin/sql</a>
directory give more details about index, foreign key, and serial number management workings
of the MusicBrainz Server. Please be advised that you'll need to understand the fundamentals
of SQL before these scripts will make sense to you.
</p>

<& /comp/section, title=>"Future database structure" &>

<p>
We also used to attempt to document our future plans for the database. But,
as it is typical in software engineering, our implementations never matched
our speculations about how we thought we'd do things in the future.
</p>

<p>
In order to get a gimpse of what we are working on the for the future, take
a look a our <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/wiki.pl?MusicBrainzDevelopment">MusicBrainz Development Wiki page</a> which
describes all sorts of work being done with MusicBrainz right now.

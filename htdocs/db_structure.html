<& /comp/sidebar,  title=>'The database structure of MusicBrainz', expand=>'documentation' &>


The relational database is the heart of MusicBrainz.
The content is placed under the OpenContent license.
Currently the content of MusicBrainz is still limited to artist names, 
albums, and the tracks.  But we are working very hard to include more 
information.  The number of entries in our database is increasing rapidly,
we expect to have the names of 1.000.000 tracks in MusicBrainz within a few 
months.  With MusicBrainz it is possible to uniquely identify artists, 
albums/CDs and tracks, and therefore allow the MusicBrainz users to refer to 
music without any ambiguities. This capability will also allow users
to exchange playlists that are based on unique track identifiers.

<p>The artist/album/track names are augmented with several databases for
administration and identification.  All tables have a Id field as a
technical key that is a locally unique number incremented each time a new
record is inserted into the table.  

<a name="MusicBrainz I database structure">
<& /comp/section, title=>'MusicBrainz I database structure' &>  
</a>

The main tables in the database are
(with the important fields):

<pre>
-Artist     Id field as key, Name, SortName, and a Global ID (GID)
-Album      Id field as key, Name, artist Id reference, and a Global ID (GID)
-Track      Id field as key, Name, artist Id reference, a Global ID (GID),
            length, year, and genre Id
-GUID       Id field as key and a GUID field that contains a acoustic 
            identification hash (relatable.com value a.k.a. TRMId)
</pre>

The above tables contain the core information. Several additional tables exist 
for the moderation process , insert process and combining the information of 
the above core tables. For example the AlbumJoin table connects the Tracks 
with the Albums. 

Connecting the core info:
<pre>
-AlbumJoin  Id field, Album Id, Track Id, and sequence number
-GUIDJoin   Id field, GUID Id, and Track Id
</pre>

Insert process info:
<pre>
-Pending    Id field, Name, Artist name, Album name, Sequence number, 
            GUID, Filename, Year, Genre name, Sha1 hash, and Duration
</pre>

Moderation proces:
<pre>
-ModeratorInfo Id field, Name, Password (simple cleartext), Privs, Accepted 
            moderations, and rejected moderations
-Changes    Id field, Table, Colom, Artist, Type of moderation, Status, 
            RowId, Previous value, New value, Moderator Id, Yes votes, 
            No votes, and Dependant Change Id
-Votes      Id field, User Id , Row Id, vote (without a capital)
</pre>

Additional info:
<pre>
-Diskid     Id field, Disk hash, Album Id, and disk table of content
-TOC        Id field, Disk number, Album Id, Amount of tracks, Leadout, 
            and 99 track lengths
-Genre      Id field, Name, and Description
-ArtistAlias Id field, Name, Ref
-Lyrics     Id field, Track Id, Text, and Writer name
-Synctext   Id field, Track Id, Type, URL, and Submittor name
-SyncEvent  Id field, Synctext Id, TimeStamp, Text
</pre>


<a name="MusicBrainz II database structure">
<& /comp/section, title=>'MusicBrainz II database structure' &>  
</a>

We want to expand MusicBrainz with more information and store more then Artist/Album/Track information. For this we need the help of a serious number of people that are willing to add the information to the thousands of records in our database. If creating the biography of an artist takes a whole day, imagine the total time needed to write 50,000 of them. We need to call upon a large number of people to help us fill this extended database. In the true spirit of MusicBrainz we give all content back to the users. 

<p>This database structure is still in the planning process. Any sugestions/additions/etc should be send to the mailing list or myself (j@mp3.nl)

The main tables in the MusicBrainz II database are
(with the important fields):
<pre>
-Person     Id field as key, RealName, SortName, and a Global ID (GID)
-Group      Id field as key, GroupName, a Global ID (GID)
-Track      Id field as key, Name, group Id reference, a Global ID (GID),
            length, year, and genre Id
-EventType  Id field as key, EventName, Name of table
-Event      Id field as key, Event Type identifier, ID field identifier within table EventTypeTable, 
            Event Start timestamp, Event End timestamp, Event Description. 
-RoleType   Id field as key, RoleName, Role Description
-Role       Id field, Person ID identifier, Group ID identifier, Role Type identifier
-GUID       Id field as key and a GUID field that contains a acoustic 
            identification hash (relatable.com value a.k.a. TRMId)
-Album      Id field as key, Name, artist Id reference, and a Global ID (GID)
-AlbumJoin  Id field, Album Id, Track Id, and sequence number
-GUIDJoin   Id field, GUID Id, and Track Id
</pre>

Other tables for Pop charts, biographies, URL references, guitar tabs, etc:
<p>In progress...<p>

	The following diagram briefly illustrates the relationships
	between the various MusicBrainz components:

<p>
	Starting with probably the most familiar part, MusicBrainz has a web
	site.&nbsp; You're reading one of its pages right now, of course.&nbsp;
	Using the MB web site, you can search, browse and edit the MusicBrainz
	database: your web browser (top left) sends HTTP requests to the
	<a href="/products/server/index.html">MB server</a>
	(right) which then accesses the database as appropriate,
	and returns a response (usually a web page showing the requested
	information) to your browser.
</p>

<p>
	As well as human-readable web pages, the MusicBrainz server also
	provides a (machine-readable) RDF interface.&nbsp; 
	<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>
	is an
	<abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>-based
	language.&nbsp;
	By sending RDF queries to the MB server, a client can query
	and add to the database.&nbsp;
	The client constructs an RDF message, and sends it to the server;
	the server parses and processes the message,
	accesses the database as necessary, and returns a response to the
	client.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Although any client <i>can</i> send RDF queries to the MusicBrainz server,
	the easiest and most reliable way to do so is by using the
	<a href="/products/client/index.html">MusicBrainz client</a>.&nbsp;
	A program makes the appropriate calls to the client library;
	then the MB client then constructs the correct RDF query, sends it to
	the server, receives the server's response, and finally returns
	the appropriate data to the calling program.&nbsp;
	Thus the program doesn't have to know anything about RDF or about
	how to contact the MusicBrainz server.
</p>

<p>
	Whilst most client applications (e.g. media players) will probably use
	only the RDF interface (via the MB client library), sometimes it is
	useful to also use the web interface at the same time.&nbsp;
	This is the approach taken by both the
	<a href="/tagger/index.html">tagger</a>
	and the
	<a href="/products/cdlookup/download.html">CD lookup tool</a>.&nbsp;
	For example the tagger will read a digital audio file,
	generate a TRM signature (using the client library),
	look up that TRM on the server (using the client library)
	and show the results to the user.&nbsp; Then, when the user
	chooses to identify the file, the tagger points its embedded
	web browser component to the MusicBrainz web site, where the user
	can perform various searches.&nbsp; Finally when the user selects
	the correct track, the tagger associates the TRM with the
	selected track (using the client library again).

<h2>CVS Modules</h2>

	<dt><a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/mb_server/">mb_server</a></dt>
	<dd>
			The MusicBrainz server software.&nbsp; To make a working MusicBrainz
			server you'll also need various other pieces of software
			(such as
			<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>
			and
			<a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>)
			and a copy of the
			<a href="/products/server/download.html">MusicBrainz database</a>
			(which isn't stored in CVS).

	<dt><a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/mb_client/">mb_client</a></dt>
	<dd>
		The MusicBrainz client library.&nbsp; 
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/trm/">trm</a></dt>
	<dd>
		The MusicBrainz trm application/library.&nbsp; This project is both a library
    and an application, used to generate TRM IDs from WAV, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files.
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/mb_tagger/">mb_tagger</a></dt>
	<dd>
		The MusicBrainz Tagger.&nbsp; You'll also need the client and the trm library and
    Borland C++ Builder 5.0 to build this project.
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/tunepimp/">tunepimp</a></dt>
	<dd>
		Easy to use library for lookup and tagger.  Does all the heavy lifting of decoding
	and lookup so you can focus on your UI.
	</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://cvs.musicbrainz.org/cvs/python-musicbrainz/">python-musicbrainz</a></dt>
	<dd>
		Python wrappers for mb_client.&nbsp; Lets you code a musicbrainz app from python.

<& /comp/sidebar, title => "Artist Subscription List - Privacy Settings" &>

<p>
	This page describes the detailed workings of the "Allow other users to see my
	subscribed artists" setting.&nbsp; 
	The default state of this preference is "on", i.e. other users can see your
	list of subscribed artists.
</p>

<p>
	You can opt to change this setting to "off", disallowing other users from
	seeing the list.&nbsp;
	However this does not provide "perfect" privacy - in some cases, it will be
	possible to infer information about the contents of your subscription list,
	even though you have disallowed others from viewing that list
	directly.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	This imperfection arises because various parts of the system behave
	differently depending on whether or not an artist has any subscribers; also,
	the number of users subscribed to each artist is available via the artist
	pages.&nbsp;
	In the most extreme (possibly contrived) example, imagine that all users
	have their subscriptions set to "public", except for exactly one user
	whose list is "private".&nbsp; In that case, any discrepancy for a given
	artist between the shown list of subscribers and the total number of
	subscribers must be down to that one user.&nbsp; Thus, you can infer what
	artists are on that user's list.&nbsp;

<& /comp/sidebar, title => "MusicBrainz Privacy Policy" &>

<p>
	From time to time we've been asked if we have a privacy policy; until
	now it's never really been written down, so maybe it's about time
	to make one.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
	You don't have to provide any personally-identifying information if
	you don't want to.&nbsp; If you choose not to provide any personal
	information, we won't "lock you out" of any part of MusicBrainz.&nbsp;
	Any personal information you choose to provide will not be revealed
	to anyone else.
</p>

<h2>Slightly Longer Summary</h2>

<p>
	There are two types of ways of using the MusicBrainz web site: you can either
	register an account and be logged in, or you can choose not to log in.&nbsp;
	If you don't log in, you can browse, search and examine the site;
	if you do log in, you can additionally edit the data, communicate with
	other users, and so on.&nbsp; If you choose to register and log in,
	then the minimum we ask of you is that you choose a unique user name
	and a password, and that your web browser accepts "session" cookies.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Now read on for the more technical details.
</p>

<h2>Web and FTP Access Logs (all users)</h2>

<p>
	Like just about all web sites, we keep logs of all web requests made
	against our servers.&nbsp; These logs include the usual stuff: your IP
	address, your browser's "User-Agent" string, which page you
	requested.&nbsp; Aggregate information about
	web and FTP traffic is made available to the public via our
	<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/usage">site usage</a> pages.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
	We use session cookies, but only if you're logged in and/or using the
	Tagger.&nbsp; We currently only use two "permanent" (i.e. non-session)
	cookies:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you download something via one of our "download" pages, we
	use a cookie to remember your preferred MusicBrainz mirror site.</li>
	<li>When you log in there's an option called "Log in permanently";
	if you activate this option, it uses a "permanent" cookie to remember
	your login details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Content and HTTP "Referrer" Data</h2>

<p>
	There is no third-party content hosted on the MusicBrainz web
	servers (e.g. Javascript, CGI etc).&nbsp; The only third-party content
	<em>loaded</em> by MusicBrainz web pages are the album cover art
	images, provided and hosted by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>.&nbsp;
	This means that Amazon will know (if they want to) your IP address,
	your User-Agent string, etc, and which MusicBrainz web page you were
	visiting (the one which included the cover art image).&nbsp;
	If you log in, you can opt out of using Amazon cover art images if you wish.
</p>

<p>
	(The above information assumes that you are using "normal" web browser
	settings, whereby images are always loaded and HTTP "referrer"
	information is always sent.)
</p>

<h2>Web Site (logged-in users)</h2>

<h3>Creating an Account</h3>

<p>
	When you create an account with MusicBrainz you need to pick a unique
	username, and choose a password.&nbsp; Other MusicBrainz users will
	know you by your username.&nbsp; You may optionally also tell us the
	URL of your "home" page, and/or a few words about yourself.&nbsp; Any
	information thus provided is made available to the public.
</p>

<p>
	You may optionally also tell us your e-mail address.&nbsp; We will
	never reveal this e-mail address to anyone.&nbsp; The only way in
	which the system can reveal your e-mail address is if you choose to send a
	message to another MusicBrainz user, <em>and</em> you tick the box marked
	"reveal my e-mail address" (this box is not ticked by default).
</p>

<h3>Moderations and Notes</h3>

<p>
	If you make any changes to the MusicBrainz database (such as adding
	any data, including TRM submissions) then the details of the changes
	you make are visible to everyone, and the change is associated with
	your username.
</p>

<h3>Artist Subscriptions</h3>

<p>
	As a logged-in user you can <em>subscribe</em> to one or more
	artists (which causes any data edits made for those artists to be
	e-mailed to you).&nbsp; By default, other users can see your list of
	subscriptions.&nbsp; However you can opt out of this, with the preference
	labelled "Allow other users to see my subscribed artists".&nbsp;
	Please <a href="/docs/20050108-1.html">read these additional notes</a>
	about artist subscriptions and privacy.
</p>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>
	MusicBrainz has a number of <a href="/list.html">mailing lists</a> to
	which you can subscribe.&nbsp; To subscribe to the mailing lists, you
	need to provide your e-mail address.&nbsp; This e-mail address will
	not be revealed to anyone, unless you post a message to the list (see
	below).
</p>

<p>
	Some of the lists allow you to post messages (whereas others only allow you to
	receive messages, for example the "Announcements" list).&nbsp; If you
	post a message, your e-mail address will be revealed to all
	subscribers of the list(s) to which you posted.&nbsp; Additionally,
	all the mailing lists also have
	<a href="http://lists.musicbrainz.org/pipermail/musicbrainz-users/">public
	archives</a>.&nbsp; If you post, then the archives will include your
	e-mail address (albeit in a form intended to provide some protection
	from spammer "harvesting").
</p>

<hr>

<p>
	Reasonable exceptions may apply to the above policy, for example to
	comply with applicable laws.&nbsp; The MusicBrainz server
	administrators (about three people in all) can of course see any
	information on the system they want to, but to be honest we're
	probably not interested enough to look.

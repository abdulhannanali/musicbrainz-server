All of these examples can be found in the <a href="/download.html">MusicBrainz
client</a> library source code download.

<p><a name="cdlookup"></a><font size="+1"><b>cdlookup.c</b></font><p>

This application demonstrates the functions that must be called to 
determine the Audio CD submit address, which can then be shown in
a standard web browser. Use the code in this sample to add CD Submit features
to your Audio CD Player/Recorder application.

<p><a name="findalbum"></a><font size="+1"><b>findalbum.c</b></font><p>

This application demonstrates how to search MusicBrainz for an album
given only the name of the album.

<p><a name="findartist"></a><font size="+1"><b>findartist.c</b></font><p>

This application demonstrates how to search MusicBrainz for an artist
given only the name of the artist.

<p><a name="findtrack"></a><font size="+1"><b>findtrack.c</b></font><p>

This application demonstrates how to search MusicBrainz for an artist
given only the name of the track.

<p><a name="getartist"></a><font size="+1"><b>getartist.c</b></font><p>

Use this application to retrieve information about an artist given the
artist's unique ID.

<p><a name="getalbum"></a><font size="+1"><b>getalbum.c</b></font><p>

Use this application to retrieve information about an album given the
album's unique ID or a CD Index ID. This sample application shows how to 
determine if an
album is a single artist album or a multiple artist (collection) album,
and how to read the information about each track in the album.

<p><a name="gettrack"></a><font size="+1"><b>gettrack.c</b></font><p>

Use this application to retrieve information about a track given the
track's unique ID.

<p><a name="gettrm"></a><font size="+1"><b>gettrm.c</b></font><p>

This application shows how to retrieve the name of the artist, album,
and track given a TRM Id and an album Id.

<p><a name="submittrm"></a><font size="+1"><b>submittrm.c</b></font><p>

Use this application to submit a TRM Id to the MusicBrainz server. In order
to use this application you need to have a MusicBrainz track id and a new
TRM id. Also, the username and password of a valid MusicBrainz user is
required to submit a TRM to MusicBrainz. While this application only allows
one TRM at a time to be submitted, the query that is used to submit a 
TRM can be used to submit a batch of TRMs with one server query.

<p><a name="tagger"></a><font size="+1"><b>tagger.c</b></font><p>

This application implements a pseudo mp3 file tagger. The appliction
demonstrates how to use the FileLookupInterface by generating a TRM
id and extracting ID3 information using the <a href="/download.html">trm</a> 
application and then passing this information on to the MusicBrainz server.
Note that this application does not actually write the downloaded
metadata back to the file or submit matched TRM Id, TrackId pairs to the server -- that is why its pseudo tagger. :-)

<p>
If you are interested in using MusicBrainz to tag music files, you should
definitely read this code to see the best way to do this.

We are the first to admit that the documentation of this project could be a bit better.
We would love to have the time to work on this. But first we want to implement the best functionality for this project. Each of the following sections point to one page of documentation.

<p>The <a href="/introduction.html">general introduction on MusicBrainz</a> gives an overview of the key features and content of MusicBrainz.

<p>In the <a href="/how.html">how does it work?</a> page the client/server model, music identification, playlist exchange, and MP3/Vorbis features are all explained.

<p>The <a href="/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions page</a> answers general stuff and licensing questions.

<p>You can read more about the roots of the project and a bit of project history in 
<a href="/history.html">our historical department</a>.

<p>Our goals for the next years are stated in <a href="/future.html">the Future and goals page</a>. 

<p>For the short term, <a href="/todo.html">the To Do page</a> lists the open tasks. If you would like to join us, this would be the place to look into for things we would like to have.

<p>On the <a href="/rob_todo.html">Rob's To Do list</a> you can find the tasks Rob has scheduled to do in the short term.

<p>The <a href="/mod_intro.html">introduction of the moderation process</a> explains the inner working of MusicBrainz. MusicBrainz relies on the users to keep the database up to date.

<p>Listed on <a href="bio.html">the biography page</a> are the people that worked on MusicBrainz. Please be warned that this page also contains pictures of the developers!

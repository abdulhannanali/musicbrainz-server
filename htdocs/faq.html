<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'Technical Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Can MusicBrainz handle international metadata?',
   answer=>'Not really. Right now MusicBrainz can handle ISO 8859-1 (Western European) character data. However, as soon as an Open Source database server has full and complete support for UTF-8, MusicBrainz will switch to that, and then MusicBrainz will be able to handle pretty much all the languages of the world.',

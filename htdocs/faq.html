<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What is metadata?',
   answer=>'Metadata is the data that is associated with music. Artist name, album name, track number, release date, audio track signature, and CD Index disk IDs  are all examples of metadata.',
   name=>'metadata'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Why the name MusicBrainz?',
   answer=>'It indicates the overall goal of the project: a lot of people (brains) collaborating to enhance the digital music experience.',
   name=>'name'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Is this service free?',
   answer=>'Yes. This service is free, because only a service that is void of monetary motivations can be truly owned by the general Internet public. This project does not belong to the people who created the site, or those who host the site. This project belongs to the people who entered and maintain the data in the system.',
   name=>'free'

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Which digital audio players support MusicBrainz?',
   answer=>'<a href="http://www.freeamp.org">FreeAmp</a> will be the first player to fully support MusicBrainz. There are no other known players to support MusicBrainz right now. Please contact the author of your favorite player and ask them to support MusicBrainz.',
   name=>'players'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Why does MusicBrainz not support genre information?',
   answer=>'Because doing genres <i>right</i> is very hard. We have thought about how to implement genres, and you can read about our current thoughts on the mater <a href="http://www.freeamp.org/pipermail/musicbrainz/2001-December/001376.html">here</a>. I feel strongly about genres and I will turn my attention to them soon.',
   name=>'genres'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Why does MusicBrainz not have more metadata, like release year?',
   answer=>'We\'re currently focusing on making the basic metadata (artist, album, tracks and various ids) system work, before we go and try to implement more things. However, we have thought what data we want to carry next -- you may want to check out this <a href="/db_structure.html">page</a> for details. If you know how to program in C/C++ or perl, please jump in and help us out to get more features implemented.',
   name=>'data'

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Who are the people responsible for creating MusicBrainz?',

<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'CD Submission Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'I\'m confused by the CD submission process. Why do some CDs have more than one CD Index id? Some of my CDs are already in the system, but they have a different number of tracks than my CD. What\'s up?',
   answer=>'The identification of CDs is a tricky matter. Please check out our <a href="/cd_submission.html">Audio CD document</a> that explains these issues.',
   name=>'cds'

<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'Licensing Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Do I need to sign a licensing agreement in order to use MusicBrainz?',
   answer=>'No. Unlike Escient\'s CDDB you do not need to sign a licensing agreement. You do need to abide by the <a href="http://opencontent.org/opl.shtml">OpenContent</a> license which covers the data in MusicBrainz. However, if you do use MusicBrainz, we would like to ask you to mention MusicBrainz in your About box or your documentation.',
   name=>'userlicense'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What license covers the metadata in MusicBrainz?',
   answer=>'The <a href="http://opencontent.org/opl.shtml">OpenContent</a> license covers the data in MusicBrainz. This means that you can use the data, distribute the data, and modify the data, but you may not charge anything for the data.',
   name=>'opencontent'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What license covers the MusicBrainz server source code?',
   answer=>'The server source code is available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL (GNU General Public License)</a>.',
   name=>'server'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What license covers the MusicBrainz client source code?',
   answer=>'The client source code is available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License)</a>. This means that closed source applications such as WinAmp and Sonique are allowed to use the client library in binary form without any fees or royalties.',
   name=>'client'
&>

<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'Technical Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Can MusicBrainz handle international metadata?',
   answer=>'Not really. Right now MusicBrainz can handle ISO 8859-1 (Western European) character data. However, as soon as an Open Source database server has full and complete support for UTF-8, MusicBrainz will switch to that, and then MusicBrainz will be able to handle pretty much all the languages of the world.',

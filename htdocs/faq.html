<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What is the purpose of this site?',
   answer=>'This site is intended to be a free, on-line encyclopedia of music information.&nbsp; We (and you, if you decide to join us) are building an open-source database containing all the information you would ever want to know about songs, albums, and artists.',
   name=>'purpose'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Why would I need to use your site? Whats wrong with Gracenote\'s CDDB?',
   answer=>' No one needs to use our site, and nothing is wrong with CDDB.&nbsp; We just have a different aim from the maintainers of CDDB.&nbsp; Check the <a href="/history.html">history page</a> for more information on the origins of this project.',
   name=>'why'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,

   name=>'name'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Is this service free?',
   answer=>'Yes.&nbsp; This service is free, because only a service that is void of monetary motivations can be truly owned by the general Internet public.&nbsp; This project does not belong to the people who created the site, or those who host the site.&nbsp; This project belongs to the people who entered and maintain the data in the system.',
   name=>'free'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What is metadata?',
   answer=>'Metadata is the data that is associated with music.&nbsp; Artist name, album name, track number, release date, audio track signature, and CD Index disc IDs are all examples of metadata.',
   name=>'metadata'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Why does MusicBrainz not support genre information?',
   answer=>'Because doing genres <i>right</i> is very hard.&nbsp; We have thought about how to implement genres, and you can read about our current thoughts on the matter <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/pipermail/musicbrainz/2001-December/001376.html">here</a>.&nbsp; I feel strongly about genres and I will turn my attention to them soon.',
   name=>'genres'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Why does MusicBrainz not have more metadata, like release year?',
   answer=>'We\'re currently focusing on making the basic metadata (artist, album, tracks and various IDs) system work, before we go and try to implement more things.&nbsp; However, we have thought what data we want to carry next -- you may want to check out this <a href="/db_structure.html">page</a> for details.&nbsp; If you know how to program in C/C++ or perl, please jump in and help us out to get more features implemented.',

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Who are the people responsible for creating MusicBrainz?',

<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'CD Submission Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'I\'m confused by the CD submission process.&nbsp; Why do some CDs have more than one CD Index ID? Some of my CDs are already in the system, but they have a different number of tracks than my CD.&nbsp; What\'s up?',
   answer=>'The identification of CDs is a tricky matter.&nbsp; Please check out our <a href="/cd_submission.html">Audio CD document</a> that explains these issues.',
   name=>'cds'

<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'Licensing Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Do I need to sign a licensing agreement in order to use MusicBrainz?',
   answer=>'No.&nbsp; Unlike GraceNote\'s CDDB you do not need to sign a licensing agreement.&nbsp; You do need to abide by the <a href="http://opencontent.org/opl.shtml">OpenContent</a> license which covers the data in MusicBrainz.&nbsp; However, if you do use MusicBrainz, we would like to ask you to mention MusicBrainz in your About box or your documentation.',

&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What license covers the metadata in MusicBrainz?',
   answer=>'The <a href="http://opencontent.org/opl.shtml">OpenContent</a> license covers the data in MusicBrainz.&nbsp; This means that you can use the data, distribute the data, and modify the data, but you may not charge anything for the data.',

&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What license covers the MusicBrainz server source code?',

<& /comp/faqfooter &>
<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'Technical Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Can MusicBrainz handle international metadata?',

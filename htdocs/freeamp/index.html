   MusicBrainz is an open community metadatabase project, which
   aims to become a comprehensive catalog of music information.
   MusicBrainz works on the concept that the internet community
   is willing to contribute and edit (moderate) the metadata 
   in the system. For more information on MusicBrainz, check out
   our <a href="/introduction.html">introduction</a>.

   <p>
   All of the data collected on this server is made available to the 
   public under the 
   <a href="http://www.opencontent.com">OpenContent</a> license. 
   This means that your work in contributing to MusicBrainz will not
   benefit some corporation -- it will benefit you and other people 
   in the internet community.

   <p>
   No personal information will ever be sent to MusicBrainz. If you choose
   to contribute metadata to MusicBrainz, FreeAmp will collect the
   metadata from your MP3 and Vorbis files and send that information to
   MusicBrainz, so it can be included in the MusicBrainz catalog.

   You might be interested to look at the MusicBrainz 
   <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a> or the other 
   <a href="/documentation.html">documentation</a> that we've collected.

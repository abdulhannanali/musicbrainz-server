<& /comp/sidebar,  title=>'The goals and future of MusicBrainz', expand=>'information' &>

MusicBrainz has set itself the goal of building an extensive music
encyclopedia. This MusicBrainz music encyclopedia must be owned and constructed
by the users, distributed across several servers, and contain almost no
errors.

<a name="superbrainz"></a>
<& /comp/section, title=>'SuperBrainz' &>  

The long term goal is to turn MusicBrainz into SuperBrainz.  SuperBrainz means
applying the ideas behind MusicBrainz to other databases, like databases with
book titles, DVDs, movies, encyclopedias, etc.  SuperBrainz is a software
package that enables the user to create a database and web site, without any
real programming. The web site and database generated by SuperBrainz should
have the same functionality as MusicBrainz, build and owned by users
submissions and corrections.  SuperBrainz is the third generation project,
building on the software and expertise of MusicBrainz and CD Index.  The aim of
SuperBrainz is to make the MusicBrainz software more general and database
independent. The moderation, voting, and distribution software should all be
highly configurable. The moderation policies for example must entered into a
database table and could be different for each field in the database.  This
project is still in the design phase.  Research publications and prototypes for
SuperBrainz will hopefully be ready in 2001.

<a name="moderation"></a>
<& /comp/section, title=>'MusicBrainz Moderation' &>  

<p>Currently, the MusicBrainz software to correct database errors with
moderation and voting is working. After being in operation for two months, 2650
correction were suggested, approved by public voting, and applied to the
database. We therefore think that the moderation software for the basic
information such as track, album, and artist names is working.
We thank all the hard working users for all their valuable contributions!

<p>The track, album and artist names can be moderated and voted because it is
deterministic. An artist only uses 1 spelling for his name, this makes the
moderation process simple. For advanced content like a biography, it is hard to
speak in term of right of wrong. This content is non-deterministic and could be
ranked against alternatives. For biographies we want to build software to
combine the best parts of user contributions and create a single biography with
multiple users. We want to extend the artist information with URIs to their
official home pages and build a list of URIs to pages that are build by their
fans. We want to extend the moderation system to make this process easier.

<a name="moderation_goals"></a>
<& /comp/section, title=>'Advanced Moderation System' &>  

If we lived in an ideal world it would be possible to give full insert, update
and delete access to all users. But we need moderation to prevent errors due to
human faults and human aggression.  The best moderation system would be no
limitations for all users.

<p>The moderation system has two fundamental
goals that often have conflicting interests:
<UL>
<LI>Stimulate good behavior</LI>
<LI>Prevent abuse</LI>
</UL>

The first goal means that good actions must be rewarded, but who determines
good or correct behavior? A majority? Human history is full of examples where
a majority was later judged to be incorrect. While democratic voting mechanisms
have their limits, we think it is the best practical thing possible.  Another
factor in the moderation process is complexity. Rewarding good behavior is the
goal, but if the reward mechanism is very complex the inexperienced users tend
to drop out.  The moderation mechanism must be simple and easy to grasp, but
sufficiently complex to recognize good actions.  The prevention of abuse is
very important. Access should be restricted to insert, modify and delete
actions. The database should be as clean as possible. But at the same time the
usage of the database should not be hindered. This conflict is easy to see with
the insert policy. You want to have as much inserts as possible with no
restrictions to the users to make contributions, but at the same time no
restrictions means you are widely open to abuse.

<p>But the pure democratic voting mechanism is also a burden for users. All
contribution must be voted on before being applied to the database. The
important variable here is number of votes required to pass/fail and amount of
time for voting process. If the average number of items a voter is willing to
vote on is X, how do we spend these X votes?

<p>A person that has provided countless valuable contributions and corrections
in the past is treated the same way as a person that uses MusicBrainz for the
first time and thinks there is an error in the database. Let's be honest, some
people are better at writing biographies then other.  Do we want to spend the
limit amount of votes X * &quot;number of voters&quot; evenly on all
contributions? Or should we require a smaller number of required votes and
voting time?

<p>If we want to build a system that will scale to keeping names, albums, tracks,
biographies, and fan-pages of <b>all</b> the artists known in the world we will
might have to deviate from the pure democratic voting process. Instead of
modeling precisely a political voting process, we want to incorporate elements of
the publishing world. All users can be moderators, but moderators that have
earned a high reputation with numerous contributions require less votes.
People like to have a good reputation and keep it. We can use this mechanism to
improve efficiency of the voting process. The only purpose of the voting mechanism
is to prevent abuse, if the abuse risk is low, then the voting can be relaxed.

<a name="reputation"></a>
<& /comp/section, title=>'It is all about reputations' &>  

A motivation for people to make good contributions to MusicBrainz is that their
work is recognized. People can see that their contribution is inserted into the
database or there modification is accepted with a vote. In the paper by Eric
Raymond titled: &quot;The cathedral versus the Bazaar&quot; he recognizes the
importance of a reputation among peers within a gift-culture.

<p>Recognizing the top moderators on the MusicBrainz web site is important, but
the reputation can also be used for access to the delete and modify actions.
With Perl it is very easy to build a browser program that creates MusicBrainz
accounts, suggests modifications, votes, and corrupts the database. Deleting
errors from the database should require the approval of one of the top ranking
moderators. 

<p>Within the advanced moderation system of MusicBrainz we want to give
reputations based on their behavior. But how do you quantify a reputation?
First you need to identify people, the current system of login name and passwd
without the need for an email address is sufficient. It is possible to make it
simple and base a reputation purely on the number of corrections that have been
approved by voting. Recognizing the value of participation in the voting
process, it is possible to increase one's reputation if he voted that day.  It
is also possible to give users that read the MusicBrainz information frequently
a higher reputation. This mechanism would require logging read activities,
perhaps undesired for privacy and system performance. 

<a name="human_encyclopedia"></a>
<& /comp/section, title=>'The human encyclopedia' &>  

The users of MusicBrainz are the ultimate experts on music. Not all information
can be entered easily inside a database. An interesting possible extension to
MusicBrainz is creating a music expert forum. Users can post messages to people
that have indicated to know something about a certain artist or genre. The
experts themselves can also send posts to the group. This is effectively a high
quality newsgroup without the problems of SPAM and need for an editor, because
it is possible to filter on reputation.  Users can select a music genre and a
group of artists and are listed on the artist page as willing to answer
questions. The history of questions and answers should be a valuable collection
of information for music fans. Messages should be handled internally, perhaps
with an option to use standard e-mail for receiving and sending.

<p>These experts on a genre and group of artists could also be used for the
moderation process. Instead of showing the modification suggestions to all users
it would be possible to vote on modifications within a genre/artist forum. It
is difficult to design such a system without running the risk of a few people
&quot;hijacking an artist&quot;. This becomes possible when the voter group
becomes to small. If the MusicBrainz database will include more information and
the daily number of votes becomes to large, it must be split.

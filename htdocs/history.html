<& /comp/sidebar, title => 'MusicBrainz Roots and History' &>

<p>
	The roots of this project are in a software program to play Audio CDs on
	UNIX systems.&nbsp; This program had the ability to display the name of the
	track it was currently playing.&nbsp; An index file was used to store the
	tracknames of an Audio CD.&nbsp; After a while a large index file with
	information about thousands of Audio CDs was created by the Internet
	community.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	This was a long time ago.&nbsp; The index file system became more widely
	used when Windows users started using this index file, but the system was
	not very mature then.&nbsp; The Windows Audio CD player could use an index file
	with track information, but the index size was limited to 640KB.&nbsp; This
	meant that Windows users could not use the large Internet index file without
	correcting software.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	In 1996 things changed when the Internet Compact Disc Database was
	created.&nbsp; Instead of a flat file with information of thousands of Audio
	CDs, the client/server model was applied.&nbsp; A single central server
	called &quot;CDDB.com&quot; could be used to access the information of Audio
	CDs.&nbsp; This server accepted new submissions of Audio CD
	information.&nbsp; At that stage the index file was reported to have grown
	by up to 800 Audio CDs per day.&nbsp; But these numbers say nothing about
	the quality of the submissions.&nbsp; The number of duplicate Audio CDs that
	now exist in the database is high &mdash; 10 entries of the same Audio CD
	under a different number is not uncommon.&nbsp; Many entries also contain
	numerous spelling errors.&nbsp; CDDB.com had no mechanism to correct
	errors.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Despite this, the system became popular and useful.&nbsp; Things changed
	dramatically when the open CDDB.com server was bought by a company that
	wanted to make money from the contributions that users had made.&nbsp; The
	index file created by the Internet community could no longer be
	copied.&nbsp; Patents were obtained and granted.&nbsp; A large public outcry
	resulted into the start of several projects to create an
	<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open&nbsp;Source</a> competitor for the
	now commercial CDDB.com.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	From the five originally started projects, two projects are still
	active &mdash; you are currently visiting one of them.&nbsp; The other, the
	<a href="http://www.freedb.org/">www.FreeDB.org</a> project was very quick in
	duplicating the functionality of the commercial CDDB.com server.&nbsp; This
	project has a very large collection of Audio CDs, more then 660,000
	entries.&nbsp; A large group of users query this information at a rate of
	more than 500,000 per day.&nbsp; The FreeDB.org server and CDDB.com server do
	not use a relational database.&nbsp; The servers use a very large collection
	of files, one for each entered Audio CD.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	The MusicBrainz project does not aim to be a drop-in replacement for
	CDDB.com.&nbsp; MusicBrainz uses a relational database and has a list of
	other features that makes it more advanced than the original CDDB.com
	server.&nbsp; MusicBrainz started as a tool called "CD Index."&nbsp; The new
	name was selected after a meeting in Amsterdam in 1999 where it was decided
	that the free insertion of information and website-based voting would be the
	focus of the second generation project.&nbsp;

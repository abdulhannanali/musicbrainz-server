The roots of this project are in a software program to play Audio CDs on
UNIX systems. This program had the ability to display the name of the
track it was currently playing. An index file was used to store the tracknames
of an Audio CD. After a while a large index file with information about
thousands of Audio CDs was created by the Internet community. 

<p>This was a long time ago. The index file system became more widely used when Windows users started using this index file, but the system was not very mature then. The Windows Audio
CD player could use an index file with track information, but the index size
was limited to 640KB.  This meant that Windows users could not use the large
Internet index file without correcting software.

<p>In 1996 things changed when the Internet Compact Disc Database was created.
Instead of a flat file with information of thousands of Audio CDs, the
client/server model was applied. A single central server called
&quot;CDDB.com&quot; could be used to access the information of Audio CDs. This
server accepted new submissions of Audio CD information. At that stage the 
index file was reported to have grown by up to
800 Audio CDs/day. But these numbers say nothing about the quality of the
submissions. The number of duplicate Audio CDs that now exist in the
database is high - 10 entries of the same Audio CD under a different number
is not uncommon. Many entries also contain numerous spelling errors.
CDDB.com had no mechanism to correct errors.

<p>Despite this, the system became popular and useful. Things changed 
dramatically when the open CDDB.com server was bought
by a company that wanted to make money from the contributions that users had
made. The index file created by the Internet community could no longer be
copied. Patents were obtained and granted.  A large public outcry resulted into
the start of several projects to create an <a
href="http://www.opensource.org">Open&nbsp;Source</a> competitor for the now
commercial CDDB.com.

<p>From the five originally started projects, two project are still active.
You are currently visiting one of them.  The other, the <a
href="http://www.freedb.org">www.FreeDB.org</a> project was very quick in
duplicating the functionality of the commercial CDDB.com server.  This project
has a very large collection of Audio CDs, more then 660.000 entries. A large
group of users query this information at a rate of more then 500.000/day. The
FreeDB.org server and CDDB.com server do not use a relational database. The
servers use a very large collection of files, one for each entered Audio CD.

<p>The MusicBrainz project does not aim to be a drop-in replacement for
CDDB.com.  MusicBrainz uses a relational database and has a list of
other features that makes it more advanced than the original CDDB.com
server.  MusicBrainz started as a tool called "CD Index."  The new name
was selected after a meeting in Amsterdam in 1999 where it was decided
that the free insertion of information and website-based voting would be
the focus of the second generation project.

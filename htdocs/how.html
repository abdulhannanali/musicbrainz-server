<p>
The MusicBrainz service is broken into two components: The server and the
client. The server contains all of the metadata and can be
<a href="search.html">searched</a> and browsed via a normal web browser.
The server also talks to MusicBrainz clients. A MusicBrainz client could
be an MP3/Vorbis/AudioCD player such as FreeAmp, WinAmp, XMMS or Sonique.
A client could also be a service like
FairTunes which could use MusicBrainz in order to properly identify
the Artists that should receive money.

<p>
In order to have complete MusicBrainz support each of these clients can
download the client library (supported on Win32, Linux and various other
UNIX variants) which is released under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
License</a> which allows closed source applications to link to the binary
form of the MusicBrainz client library. There are no royalties or other
fees charged for this.

Right now Napster does not have a clue what music people are actually
trading. The files are named by the people who ripped and encoded the file
in the first place, and each person has a slightly different way of doing
things. Consequently, when a user searches for music on Napster, and they
are looking for "Billy and the Boingers" they won't find tracks
by someone who erroneously named their files after "Billy and the
Bongers". However, MusicBrainz will be able to provide a unique
ID for each track, then a user will be able to search for that unique ID,
rather than searching by track name.

<p>Of course there are two sides to the coin. The RIAA will also be able
to identify the tracks of its member companies and then be able to go after
people who pirate these tracks. This technology will be created, whether or not
we like it -- if we can create the technology and create it in such a fashion
that it benefits everyone, then the Internet community wins.

<p>
Another group of people that will win with this system are the Artists. With
the use of MusicBrainz, services like <a href="http://www.fairtunes.com">
FairTunes</a> will be able to create a precise system that will allow users
to compensate artists for the music that they may have downloaded without
permission from the record labels. This way the people who love music can
give money to their favorite artist, while cutting out the record labels.

<& /comp/section, title=>'Playlist Exchange' &>  

As mentioned above, people who encode MP3 files tend to use their own
favorite file naming scheme. This results in the fact that playlists cannot
be exchanged between users, unless they have exactly the same naming
convention and the same music collection.

<p>These facts pretty much prevent a lot of people from swapping
playlists. Using MusicBrainz unique IDs, intelligent MP3 players will be
able to create playlists that contain all the metadata about the playlist
as well as the unique IDs for each one of the tracks. If user A passes an
intelligent playlist to user B, user B's player can play the playlist
because it will be able to cross reference the items in user A's
playlist with the tracks in user B's collection. Furthermore, user B can
choose to have the player purchase the missing tracks, or download the
tracks from a file swapping service such as Napster or Scour, and then
have the player automatically tip the artists using FairTunes.

<p>This creates a powerful system that seamlessly enhances the digital
audio experience and actually funnels money to artists.

<p>
Relatable.com has recently integrated their audio track recognition software
into FreeAmp 2.1 beta 6 and higher. Anyone that opts in to use the 
Relatable features will also be automatically contributing their
metadata to the MusicBrainz server.

<p>
If the MusicBrainz server ever sees the same metadata and track signature 
twice, it will accept the metadata into its database. With enough people 
using FreeAmp with the Relatable features enabled, this server should be 
automatically populated with data!  

<p>
This process of gathering data will be 
prone to errors. This process is going to get coupled with a data 
editing/moderation system in the near future. I believe that if we have 
the basic data in place, we can appeal to the Open Source community to help 
clean the data up and build a useful open metadata server that everyone 
can use to aid our enjoyment and discovery of digital audio.

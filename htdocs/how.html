Relatable.com has recently integrate the audio track recognition software
into FreeAmp 2.1 beta 6 and higher. Anyone that opts in to use the 
Relatable features will also be automatically contributing their
metadata to the MusicBrainz server.

<p>
If the MusicBrainz server ever sees the same metadata and track signature 
twice, it will accept the metadata into its database. With enough people 
using FreeAmp with the Relatable features enabled, this server should be 
automatically populated with data!  

<p>
This process of gathering data will be 
prone to errors. This process is going to get coupled with a data 
editing/moderation system in the near future. I believe that if we have 
the basic data in place, we can appeal to the Open Source community to help 
up clean the data up and build a useful open metadata server that everyone 
can use to aid our enjoyment and discovery of digital audio.

<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'Welcome to MusicBrainz!' &>  


<p>
   MusicBrainz is the second generation incarnation of the 
   <a href="http://www.cdindex.org"> CD Index</a>. This server is designed 
   to enable Audio CD and MP3/Vorbis players to download metadata about the 
   music they are playing. All of the data collected on this server 
   is made available to the public under the 
   <a href="http://www.opencontent.com">OpenContent</a> license. 

   <p>
   Over the next few weeks the FreeAmp, MusicBrainz, Relatable.com and 
   EMusic.com teams will continue to work out the kinks in the system and 
   fine-tune the data collection and maintenance
   algorithms. This server should be fully active and ready for the general
   public to participate this fall. In the meantime, please feel free
   to look around and see what MusicBrainz has to offer.
   There is a client library that 
   application authors can incorporate into their applictions to quickly
   and easily add MusicBrainz support. The source code for the client library
   and the server source code can be obtained 
   <a href="/download.html">here</a>.

   I have recieved two hot job offers from companies who wish to
   support/work with MusicBrainz. I will soon accept one of these offers
   and work on MusicBrainz will continue. Yeah! More details to follow!
   <p>
   I am now interested in finding some sponsors who would be interested in
   helping build the MusicBrainz community. I would like to offer awards
   to the most active members of the community. If you are interested in
   supporting the MusicBrainz community in this way, please

   MusicBrainz is no longer sponsored by EMusic, though the site is still 
   run on an EMusic server. Unfortunately I've lost my job in the latest 
   round of lay-offs.

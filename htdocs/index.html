<& /comp/title, title=>'Welcome to MusicBrainz!' &>  


<p>
   MusicBrainz is the second generation incarnation of the 
   <a href="http://www.cdindex.org"> CD Index</a>. This server is designed 
   to enable Audio CD and MP3/Vorbis players to download metadata about the 
   music they are playing. All of the data collected on this server 
   is made available to the public under the 
   <a href="www.opencontent.com">OpenContent</a> license. 

   <p>
   Over the next few weeks the FreeAmp, MusicBrainz, Relatable.com and 
   EMusic.com teams will continue to work out the kinks in the system and 
   fine-tune the data collection and maintenance
   algorithms. This server should be fully active and ready for the general
   public to participate this fall. In the meantime, please feel free
   to look around and see what MusicBrainz has to offer.
   There is a client library that 
   application authors can incorporate into their applictions to quickly
   and easily add MusicBrainz support. The source code for the client library
   and the server source code can be obtained 
   <a href="/download.html">here</a>.

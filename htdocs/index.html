   MusicBrainz is a community music metadatabase that attempts to create
   a comprehensive music encyclopedia. Automatic Audio CD and digital audio 
   track identification using community supplied and maintained data
   is the first goal of MusicBrainz.

<p>
   In the future, MusicBrainz will have a genre system and a comprehensive
   geneology of music, tracking not only music releases, but also detailed
   information about who contributed to a piece of music. MusicBrainz will
   keep track of which artists/performers/engineers contributed to
   a piece of music, and when these contributions took place. The system 
   will also keep track of artist influences on each other and many more 
   pieces of information to create a comprehensive geneology of modern music.

<p>

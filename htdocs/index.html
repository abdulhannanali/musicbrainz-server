   to enable Audio CD and MP3/Vorbis players to download metadata about the 
   music they are playing. All of the data collected on this server 
   is made available to the public under the 
   <a href="http://www.opencontent.org">OpenContent</a> license.

   I've been laid off from my position at 
   <a href="http://bitzi.com/bboard/message?message_id=18393&forum_id=1667">Bitzi</a> and thus I need to find a new job! Bitzi was the main MusicBrainz
   sponsor, and in order to keep development on MusicBrainz moving forward
   at a raipid pace I would like to find another company who would be intested
   in hiring me full/part time to continue my work on this project.
   Please <a href="mailto:rob@eorbit.net">drop me a line</a> if you know of
   a company who might be interested. [ <a href="http://www.mayhem-chaos.net/resume.html">Resume</a> ]

<& /comp/title, title=>'Welcome to MusicBrainz!' &>  

<font color=red><b>News:</b></font> Version 1.0.0-pre3 of the client
library us now available and a data dump from this server is also
available at the <a href="/download.html">download</a> page.

<p>
   This is the musicbrainz.org test server.  MusicBrainz is the 
   second generation incarnation of the <a href="http://www.cdindex.org">
   CD Index</a>. This server is designed to enable Audio CD and MP3/Vorbis
   players to download metadata about the music they are playing.

   <p>
   Recently <a href="http://beta.relatable.com">Relatable</a> has started 
   supporting the <a href="http://www.freeamp.org">FreeAmp</a> MP3/Vorbis
   player and they have Open Sourced their audio data signature generation
   code. This code identifies an audio track based on its audio signature,
   and if a track contains any metadata, this metadata and the audio track
   signature are sent to this MusicBrainz server if you have the Relatable
   features enabled in FreeAmp.

   <p>Once the MusicBrainz service goes live, the server will contain
   the data from the CD Index, the data from 
   <a href="http://www.freedb.org">freedb.org</a>, and all the metadata
   from the <a href="http://www.emusic.com">EMusic.com</a> MP3 database.
   This should bring the total number of albums in MusicBrainz to well
   over 250,000 albums!

   <p>
   Over the next few weeks the FreeAmp, MusicBrainz, Relatable.com and 
   EMusic.com teams will continue to work out the kinks in the system and 
   fine-tune the data collection
   algorithms. This server should be fully active and ready for the general
   public to participate this fall. There is a client library that 
   application authors can incorporate into their applictions to quickly
   and easily add MusicBrainz support. The source code for the client library
   and the server source code can be obtained 
   <a href="/download.html">here</a>.

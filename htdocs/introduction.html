<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'Introduction to MusicBrainz' &>

MusicBrainz is a network of web sites that form an 
<b>open music encyclopedia</b>. Like a normal encyclopedia the MusicBrainz 
encyclopedia contains numerous facts, specifically about artists, their 
albums, and tracks.

<p>
One of the key features of MusicBrainz is that it is completely open and free.
You can download the complete music encyclopedia, without any cost.
Consumers and music companies have free access to all information.
Another key feature is that contributions are also open. Users can
submit new information to MusicBrainz or correct errors in the information.
The final key feature is that MusicBrainz is a network of web sites without a central server.
All MusicBrainz web sites are equal, this means nobody owns the content. This 
is a deliberate decision to keep everything as open as possible.

<p>
Currently the content of MusicBrainz is still limited to artist names, 
albums, and the tracks.  But we are working very hard to include more 
information.  The number of entries in our database is increasing rapidly,
we expect to have the names of 1.000.000 tracks in MusicBrainz within a few 
months.  With the MusicBrainz it is possible to uniquely identify artists, 
albums/CDs and tracks, and therefore allow the MusicBrainz users to refer to 
music without any ambiguities. This capability will also allow users
to <a href="how.html#playlist_exchange">exchange playlists</a> that are 
based on unique track identifiers.

<p>
MusicBrainz is very easy to use because we are using audio track 
recognition software from <a href="http://www.relatable.com">Relatable.com</a>.
MusicBrainz aims to provide consumers and music companies with free
access to music <a href="faq.html#metadata">metadata</a>. 
This software generates a unique signature for an MP3, Vorbis, AAC, or other 
compressed music file from the first 30 seconds of audio data. This unique 
signature will allow a MP3 player to look up the related information in 
MusicBrainz, and if the information is available, the MP3 player can then 
download the information and store it into the compressed music file for 
future use. If the data is not available, the user will be able to enter 
the information for that track and that trackname will then be inserted into 
the MusicBrainz network.

<p>
The ability to <a href="/how.html#music_identification">
uniquely identify</a> artists, albums and tracks, will allow 
other music sites/programs to more intelligently communicate about music.
For instance, <a href="http://www.lyricfind.com">LyricFind.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.fairtunes.com">FairTunes</a> are currently discussing 
partnerships with MusicBrainz to key their systems against the unique
identifiers in the MusicBrainz database. If you are interested in working with
MusicBrainz, please <a href="mailto:rob@emusic.com">drop us a line</a>.

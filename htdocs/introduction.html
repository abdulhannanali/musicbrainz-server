<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'Introduction to MusicBrainz' &>

<p>
MusicBrainz is a user maintained community music metadatabase. Music metadata is
information such as the name of an artist, the name of an album and list of tracks
that appear on an album. MusicBrainz collects this information about music and
makes it available to the public so that music players can retrieve information
about the music that is playing. For instance, an audio CD does not contain the
name of the artist, album or a listing of the tracks. A music player can
use the physical characteristics of an audio CD to lookup the correct metadata
for the CD and show it to the user during playback.
</p>

<p>MusicBrainz also takes this concept one step further in applying it to digital audio
files like MP3 files and Ogg Vorbis files. The metadata contained in these files is often
incorrect or missing altogether. If this data is not present or correct, it makes it
difficult for users to find the music they wish to play. Many MP3 lovers have
a huge collection of MP3 files but often have a hard time finding the music to which they
want to listen. The MusicBrainz solution for this is the 
<a href="/tagger/index.html">MusicBrainz Tagger</a>, a Windows application that uses 
acoustic fingerprints (TRMs) to semiautomatically identify tracks in your music 
collection and then write clean and accurate metadata to your music files.
</p>

<p>
The MusicBrainz web site provides a catalog of music data that is known to MusicBrainz. 
Please understand that MusicBrainz only provides the data about the music and <b>not
the music itself</b>. MusicBrainz does not condone copyright infringement and thus 
cannot help you find the best place to illegally download copyrighted works.  
</p>

<p>
MusicBrainz users can browse and search this catalog to 
examine what music bands have published and how artists relate to each other to
discover new music. The music metadata and its ability to uniquely identify music 
will also enable non-ambiguous communication about music, and will allow the Internet 
community to discover new music without any of the bias introduced by marketing 
departments of the recording industry. 
</p>

<p>
Another important aspect of the web site is the creation and maintenance of the data.
All of the data in MusicBrainz is user contributed and user maintained. This means
that if you spot a mistake in the database, you should take the initiative to 
<a href="/login.html">create yourself a MusicBrainz account</a> (for free of course!) and
<a href="/mod_intro.html">edit the data</a>. MusicBrainz will never share your
personal information with anyone (you don't even have to give us your email address)
and we will not spam you with anything. We believe in the privacy of our users and
since our users are our lifeblood we would be stupid to disrespect our contributors.
</p>

<p>
Please contribute your knowledge about
music and MusicBrainz will share your knowledge with others and in time MusicBrainz
can become the most powerful and comprehensive music service in existence. In return for 
your hard work, MusicBrainz makes the data that users have
contributed <a href="/products/server/download.html">available for download</a>
by the public. Some portions of the data are placed into the 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain">Public Domain</a>,
and some portions are covered by a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative 
Commons</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0">license</a>. Please take a look at our 
<a href="/products/server/download.html">server/data product page</a>.

<p>
This introduction serves as the most basic crash course on what MusicBrainz does. The
MusicBrainz project has many goals for the future with the hopes of changing how consumers
enjoy their music collections. The detailed current status, the plans for the
future, our views on working with commercial companies and our plans for creating a 
non-profit corporation are covered in great detail in our 
<a href="/papers/mb_nonprofit.html">MusicBrainz Non-Profit White Paper</a>. 
</p>

<p>With this short introduction, we leave you to explore MusicBrainz. Welcome and enjoy 
your stay!

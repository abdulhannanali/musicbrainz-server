<& /comp/sidebar,  title=>'Database license white paper', expand=>'documentation' &>

This document examines the issues involved in applying the ideas of
Free Software and Open Souce to the realm of relational databases. The
focus is on the requirements of a copyleft database license, called
GPL Data License (GDL). Readers are assumed to be familiar with
topics such as <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free software</a>, 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#WhatIsCopyleft">CopyLeft</a>,
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#TOCGPL">GPL</a>,
and the difference with 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</a> in general.<p>

If you think copyleft databases are not an issue, skip to the <a href="#4.">case study</a> section and see the example projects that already gathered millions of records and thousends of users.

<& /comp/section, title=>'1. Do we need a new license?' &>  
</a>

First we define the license problem involving databases. Kernels,
compilers, web servers, database servers form the heart of the Free
Software world, the usage of Free Software ideas outside the source code
realm is still somewhat limited. The Free Content License exists now
for a while, as well as the GNU Documentation license. However these
licenses do not properly describe the unique world of databases. Free
Software licenses speak of librairies, linking, binairies, etc. where
as the database world speaks of record selection, database linking,
data-mining and many other terms.  Because the OpenContent license
and GNU documentation license also contain terms that do not translate
to the database domain, it is impossible to define what constitutes a
derived work and re-publication. Those terms are essential to upholding
the spirit of copyleft.  Database content is much more dynamic when
compared to source code and can be republished in various forms on the
Internet. Source code behaves much more like a binairy functions: you
either used GPL code or not. For database content you can copy a few
records or all, link to non-free database records with a URL, create
scripts that combine content within the browser, etc.  We will conclude
this paragraph with examples that should indicate the limits of the
licenses written outside the database domain. If people think the existing
licenses translated OK towards database <a href="mailto:license@mp3.nl">we
will gladely hear</a> for each example below if they are allowed or not.<BR>

The examples below might seem far fetched to some people, but they have all
already presented themselves in practice. For music information there are two GPL friendly
projects, <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org">musicbrainz</a>, 
<a href="http://www.freedb.org">FreeDB</a> versus for-profit companies and their 
databases: <a href="http://www.cddb.com">CDDB</a>, <a href="http://www.allmusic.com">Allmusic</a>, <a href="http://www.muze.com">Muze</a>, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com">Rollingstone</a>, but also projects in the middle <a href="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists/">such as DMOZ.org</a> with almost 45.000 artists. The big question is, to what level is it allowed to combine the information of these projects or is the listing of copyleft and non-free URLs already a violation:-)<p>

<UL>
<LI>Is an Open Source MP3 ripping program allowed to lookup an Audio CD at both the
non-free database (CDDB.com) with a _very_ restrictive license, the Public Domain licensed database (FreeDB.org), and the Copyleft database (MusicBrainz.org)?</LI>
<LI>Same as above, but now the Copyleft database also has non-factual copyrighted information such as biographies of the artists on the Audio CD?</LI>
<LI>Can I copy eight/all/a few thousand/a hundred/N records from a copyleft database and put them on my homepage with links to similair non-free databases?</LI>
<LI>Can I copy a few records from a copyleft database and put
them on my copyrighted non-copyleft homepage?</LI>
<LI>May I copy a full copyleft database, run a database server behind my web server and extend it with links to a search script for a non-free database, filled with overlapping information?</LI>
<LI>Can I copy a significant number of (textual) records from a copyleft database and put them on my homepage, and combine each textual record with a link to a picture
within a for-profit database?</LI>
<LI>Can I copy a significant number of records of text from a copyleft database and put them on my homepage, and combine each textual record with a non-free copyrighted picture from another database?</LI>
<LI>Is it a copyleft violation to copy a large number of records from a copyleft database and put them on my homepage, together with a JavaScript lookup script that takes information from another for-profit database?</LI>
<LI>Do I violate the copyleft license if I only wrote a program that asks the user for a search keyword, connects to several search web sites, combines the information from both copyleft &amp;&amp; non-free databases, and displays the information.</LI>
<LI>Same as above, but not if I wrote such a program, but used it.</LI>
<LI>Same situation, but now the user can select the databases to search, is warned that mixing of free and non-free might violate a license; Does the programmer violate copyleft, does the end-user?</LI>
<LI>Is it a copyleft violation if I extend my for-profit database and web site with
a lookup button besides each record that searches related information at a
copyleft database?</LI>

<& /comp/section, title=>'2. Maximize user benefit' &>  
</a>

The aim of the GPL Data License is to maximize the benefit toward the
general public of the Free Software. The direct benefit is that the
user obtains a good product, for which he may not be charged. Only
the service of providing means to access that data may come at a cost,
the data itself may not be sold. The OPL user must have the freedom to
download the entire database at resonable cost and use it for private
purposes as he or she pleases.<p>

The indirect benefit of freedom is that people may choose to increase the
size of the database or expand it with other types of information. When
the database increase in both size and reach it attracts more developers
willing to use this information within application or web sites. With
free access user are also more motivated to correct errors and keep
the information current. This upward spiral of positivity creates a
powerfull force. Companies with a competing for-profit database may find
it difficult or impossible to follow this upwards spiral, leaving them
the option to join or to struggle.<p>

To preserve the freedom you may not modify the content of the database
and re-publish the information if you do not give full access. The freedom
of the users must be preserved. It is not allowed to take the Free Data,
extend it, and charge users money for this extended version.

The user may do anything within the privacy of his own computer with
the Free Data. For example, Free Data may be used to check for-profit
databases for errors or missing information. Only with re-publication
the copyleft kicks in.<p>

The three golden rules of Freedom must be obeyed for a new Free Data license:
<UL>
<LI>An unlimited right to copy be granted.</LI>
<LI>An unlimited right to use be granted.</LI>
<LI>An unlimited right to modify for personal use be granted.</LI>
</UL>

<& /comp/section, title=>'3. PD, BSD, LGPL, and GPL' &>  
</a>

There is currently no general license for Free Data. For-profit databases
are protected with custom contracts or copyright law. Databases licensed
under a Public Domain (PD) license have no restrictions on re-publication
or derived works. Companies can take a PB licensed database, extend
it and ask money for the content. For a Free Data license such as the
LGPL for databases there are restrictions on re-publication of derived
works. Asking money for the content is not allowed, a small fee for
transportation is OK. Re-publishing derived works from an LGPL database
is permitted as long as the whole new database is made available to
the public.  The LGPL license for software is often used for libraries
to increase the popularity with users or usage by companies. Using
the LGPL license for Free Data instead of the GPL could be motivated
by similair reasons.  The GPL database license places further rules
on using Open Data. The GPL license has strongest focus on freedom, it
requires that the Free Data is not mixed with a for-profit database when
re-published.<p>

Some licenses for software have a rule that derived works explicitly
carry the name of the creator/author/contributors. For databases we feel
that this rule to pay credit is not needed to preserve Freedom and leave
it up to, for example, a web page to mention the credits.<p>

Another distinction to make in a license is between commercial users and
non-commercial users/companies. We also avoid making this distinction
because it conflicts with the copyleft principles.<p>

A translation of the BSD license towards to context of databases would
probably be that the BSD license is similair to the PD license, except
the original creator keeps the copyright, the database needs to carry the
text of the BSD license, and proper acknowledgements must be made. For
the remainder of this document we do not consider the BSD license any
longer and stick with PD, LGPL, and GPL. The reason for that is the
similarity in database context of the PD license and the BSD license.

<& /comp/section, title=>'4. Companies and Free Data' &>  
</a>

When companies use Free Data it always implies that the data will be used
to support their process for generating revenues. This can have both a
possitive, negative, or neutral impact on the freedom of users. Revenues
may be obtained from consultancy work that is required to enhance a
web site with Free Data. Companies may get paid to add a non-existing
feature to Free Data. Companies with an overlapping for-profit database
may use Free Data to detect faulty or missing records.<p>

From the viewpoint of Free Data there are three company types of
interest. The first type has a competing non-free database. These
companies have the join/struggle option. They may not combine
their content with Free Data. The second company type leases/pays
companies of the first type for use of their for-profit database. For
example, companies selling Audio CDs on a web site like <a
href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a> pay companies like <a
href="http://www.muze.com">muze.com</a> $25.000 per year for access
to their non-free database containing artist and album info, including
album cover pictures. The third company type does not have, or rent a
database, but will do so if it comes free of charge with perhaps the
copyleft restriction.

An alternative division of companies is to look at their current usage of
database and what they might use in the future. This alternative division
is important to make when we talk about the implication of using PD,
LGPL, or GPL.  For example, a company currently pays a large sum every
month to access a for-profit database.  This company would switch to a
PD version if available, but would not use a copyleft database because
the spirit of Free Data conflicts with their 'patent loving culture'.<p>

The above table lists the different switches a company can make for a
certain database. On the side are the four possible data licenses that a
company has now, the top row indicates the future data license. The row
named 'PD' (Public Domain) has a '-/+' sign in the colom 'for-profit',
meaning that a switch type from PD to for-profit is neutral to the Free
Data principles. The above devision is in most cases purely theoretical
as Free Data is scarse. However for license issues the difference
is crusial. The biggest win are companies that switch from for-profit databases towards GPL Free Data.<p>

Software is sometimes released under the LGPL to increase populairty,
likewise a database can be released under LGPL or even PD. A reason for
not using the GPL is the notion that more companies will use the Free
Data if the LGPL is used, or a PD license is used to obtain a maximum
amount of industry support at the expense of all copyleft ideas.

     </tr>

<& /comp/tableend, attrs=>'' &>  

The first company type, data-freebies, does not want to use the data if
it comes with any strings attached. Data-freebies will only use database
under the PB license that can be extended and charged money for. This
company type does not want to contribute their extensions back to the
community. A BSD like requirement of proper credit might even go to far
for them. The second type, data-mixers, what to copy and use the database,
but want to integrate it with their own database. All modifications
they make to the original database, such as inserts or record updates,
will be contributed back to the community. However the record in their
own private database will not be shared with the community and remains
off-limits. The third class are the data-winners, they are fully compliant
with the idea of copyleft, they are the RedHat of databases. They will
always contribute things back to the community and keep all extensions
copyleft. They fully understand the value of copyleft. The final type
of company, data-losers, do not appriciate copyleft. They will use the
databases which are available to them. They do not have the time or
interest to read the license and will just download it, if available.<p>

When looking for a license of your database you might consider picking
the LGPL license to bing in the data-mixer companies. These companies
will use your data, but a license for data-winners would give the true
spirit of copyleft. For a database license it might be important to
gather more users and companies, but what is the added value of pleasing
data-freebie companies? Data-freebie companies will maybe extend your
user-base, they will not extend your database. Are the extra users worth
the loss of Freedom for your users?

<& /comp/section, title=>'5. Users and Free Data' &>  
</a>

If Free Data gains momentum with users, it can grow into a powerfull
force.  The copyleft feature of the Free Data would result in a strict
division of the Free world and the for-profit world. In the long term this
could result in a deminished role of for-profit databases in areas where
users can create and maintain the Free Data themselves. For example,
a Free music database with artists and their albums has a large user
interest, a Free database of ocean water levels and temperatures will
probably not appeal a sufficiently large and active user group to be
viable.  The size, commitment, and computer skills of a user group are
the important properties that determine if a Free database is viable.
Another factors have more to do with the properties of the data itself.
For example when Free Data is expensive to collect, time consuming
to collect, or need frequent updates the user group is strained and
Free Data might not be viable. For the context of this license a very
important property of the user group is their understanding of the Free
Software principles and their appriciation of the freedom that comes
with the Free Data.

<& /comp/section, title=>'4. Derived works and fair use' &>  
</a>

A very difficult issue is were do we place the border between a derived work and a new work that was only inspired by Free Data.<p>

In the examples we have seen a few parameters that play a role in the derived work.
For example, if the database is copied in full, or that only a limited number of records are copied.

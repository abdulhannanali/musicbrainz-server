This document examines the issues involved in applying the ideas of Open Souce to the realm of relational databases. The focus is on the requirements of a copyleft database license, called Open Data License (ODL). Readers are assumed to be familiar with topics such as <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#WhatIsCopyleft">CopyLeft</a>, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#TOCGPL">GPL</a>.

<& /comp/section, title=>'1. Do we need a new license?' &>  
</a>

First we define the license problem involving databases. Kernels, compilers, web servers, database servers form the heart of the Open Source world, the usage of Open Source ideas outside the source code realm is still somewhat limited. The Open Content License exists now for a while, as well as the GNU Documentation license. However these licenses do not properly describe the unique world of databases. Open Source licenses speak of librairies, linking, binairies, etc. where as the database world speaks of record selection, database linking, data-mining and many other terms. Because the OpenContent license and GNU documentation license also contain terms that do not translate to the database domain, it is impossible to define what constitutes a derived work and re-publication. Those terms are essential to upholding the spirit of copyleft. We will conclude this paragraph with examples that should indicate the limits of the licenses written outside the database domain. Can I copy a number of records from your copyleft database and put them on my homepage, combined with non-free copyrighted pictures? Is it a copyleft violation to have a web-based for-profit database and some JavaScript code that combines the information within a browser with records from a copyleft database at another site?

<& /comp/section, title=>'2. Maximize user benefit' &>  
</a>

The aim of the Open Data License is to maximize the benefit toward the general public of the Open Data. The direct benefit is that the user obtains a good product, for which he may not be charged. Only the service of providing means to access that data may come at a cost, the data itself may not be sold. The OPL user must have the freedom to download the entire database at resonable cost and use it for private purposes as he or she pleases.<p>

The indirect benefit of freedom is that people may choose to increase the size of the database or expand it with other types of information. When the database increase in both size and reach it attracts more developers willing to use this information within application or web sites. With free access user are also more motivated to correct errors and keep the information current. This upward spiral of positivity creates a powerfull force. Companies with a competing for-profit database may find it difficult or impossible to follow this upwards spiral, leaving them the option to join or to struggle.

To preserve the freedom you may not modify the content of the database and re-publish the information if you do not give full access. The freedom of the users must be preserved. It is not allowed to take the Open Data, extend it, and charge users money for this extended version.

<& /comp/section, title=>'3. Companies and Open Data' &>  
</a>

When companies use Open Data it always implies that the data will be used to support their process for generating revenues. This can have both a possitive, negative, or neutral impact on the freedom of users. Revenues may be obtained from consultancy work that is required to enhance a web site with Open Data. Companies may get paid to add a non existing feature to Open Data. Companies with an overlapping for-profit database may use Open Data to detect faulty or missing records.<p>

For the intrest of Open Data there are only three company types of interest. The first has a competing for-profit database. These companies have the join/struggle option. They may not combine their content with Open Data. The second company type leases/pays companies of the first type for use of their for-profit database. These comapanies

<& /comp/section, title=>'4. GPL and LGPL' &>  
</a>

The different of a GPL license for Data and a LGPL license for Data is the terms for re-publication.

The LGPL is a relaxation of the license to accelarate the usage of the Open Data.

<& /comp/section, title=>'4. Derived works' &>  
</a>

A very difficult issue is were do we place the border between a derived work and a new work that was only inspired by Open Data.<p>

The information in the database is free to be used, and even incorporated in a derived work, as long as that work is also covered by the same license.
The hosting service is not charging for the data, but rather for the service of providing a means to access that data.
The original owner(s) of any data, which requires that no one else's data was used to create the data, may release the data under any other license(s) they so desire.

for-profit database owners

Most offer the entire database at resonable cost.

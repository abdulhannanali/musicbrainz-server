<& /comp/sidebar,  title=>'Database license white paper', expand=>'documentation' &>

This document examines the issues involved in applying the
ideas of Free Software and Open Souce to the realm of relational
databases. The focus is on the requirements of a copyleft database
license, called GPL Data License (GDL). Readers are assumed to
be familiar with topics such as <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free
software</a>, <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</a>, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#WhatIsCopyleft">CopyLeft</a>,
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#TOCGPL">GPL</a>.

<& /comp/section, title=>'1. Do we need a new license?' &>  
</a>

First we define the license problem involving databases. Kernels,
compilers, web servers, database servers form the heart of the Free
Software world, the usage of Free Software ideas outside the source code
realm is still somewhat limited. The Free Content License exists now
for a while, as well as the GNU Documentation license. However these
licenses do not properly describe the unique world of databases. Free
Software licenses speak of librairies, linking, binairies, etc. where
as the database world speaks of record selection, database linking,
data-mining and many other terms. Because the OpenContent license and GNU
documentation license also contain terms that do not translate to the
database domain, it is impossible to define what constitutes a derived
work and re-publication. Those terms are essential to upholding the
spirit of copyleft. We will conclude this paragraph with examples that
should indicate the limits of the licenses written outside the database
domain. Can I copy a number of records from your copyleft database and put
them on my homepage, combined with non-free copyrighted pictures? Is it
a copyleft violation to have a web-based for-profit database and some
JavaScript code that combines the information within a browser with
records from a copyleft database at another site?

<& /comp/section, title=>'2. Maximize user benefit' &>  
</a>

The aim of the GPL Data License is to maximize the benefit toward the
general public of the Free Software. The direct benefit is that the
user obtains a good product, for which he may not be charged. Only
the service of providing means to access that data may come at a cost,
the data itself may not be sold. The OPL user must have the freedom to
download the entire database at resonable cost and use it for private
purposes as he or she pleases.<p>

The indirect benefit of freedom is that people may choose to increase the
size of the database or expand it with other types of information. When
the database increase in both size and reach it attracts more developers
willing to use this information within application or web sites. With
free access user are also more motivated to correct errors and keep
the information current. This upward spiral of positivity creates a
powerfull force. Companies with a competing for-profit database may find
it difficult or impossible to follow this upwards spiral, leaving them
the option to join or to struggle.<p>

To preserve the freedom you may not modify the content of the database
and re-publish the information if you do not give full access. The freedom
of the users must be preserved. It is not allowed to take the Free Data,
extend it, and charge users money for this extended version.

<& /comp/section, title=>'3. Companies and Free Data' &>  
</a>

When companies use Free Data it always implies that the data will be used
to support their process for generating revenues. This can have both a
possitive, negative, or neutral impact on the freedom of users. Revenues
may be obtained from consultancy work that is required to enhance a
web site with Free Data. Companies may get paid to add a non existing
feature to Free Data. Companies with an overlapping for-profit database
may use Free Data to detect faulty or missing records.<p>

From the viewpoint of Free Data there are five company
types of interest. The first type has a competing non-free
database. These companies have the join/struggle option. They may
not combine their content with Free Data. The second company type
leases/pays companies of the first type for use of their for-profit
database. For example, companies selling Audio CDs on a web site like
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a> pay companies like <a
href="http://www.muze.com">muze.com</a> $25.000 per year for access
to their non-free database containing artist and album info, including
album cover pictures. The third company type does not have, or rent a
database, but will do so if it comes free of charge with the copyleft restriction. The fourth type
does not use have, or rent a database, but will do so if it comes 
free of charge, without the 
profit

<& /comp/section, title=>'4. GPL and LGPL' &>  
</a>

The different of a GPL license for Data and a LGPL license for Data is the terms for re-publication.

The LGPL is a relaxation of the license to accelarate the usage of the Free Data.

The middleman has stripped it away.

<& /comp/section, title=>'4. Derived works' &>  
</a>

A very difficult issue is were do we place the border between a derived work and a new work that was only inspired by Free Data.<p>

The information in the database is free to be used, and even incorporated in a derived work, as long as that work is also covered by the same license.
The hosting service is not charging for the data, but rather for the service of providing a means to access that data.
The original owner(s) of any data, which requires that no one else's data was used to create the data, may release the data under any other license(s) they so desire.

for-profit database owners

Most offer the entire database at resonable cost.

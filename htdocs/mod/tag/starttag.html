     What does that mean? <p>

     Easy. When you look at an <a href="/showartist.html?artistid=65">artist
     page</a> or an <a href="/showalbum.html?albumid=5955">album page</a>
     the title bar of the shown albums will have a checkbox. Click the
     checkbox to <i>tag</i> or <i>untag</i> the album:
   
     <blockquote><img src="/images/tag_image.gif"></blockquote>

     Once you've tagged a set of albums, you can hit the Done Tagging link
     listed at the top of each album to finish tagging. You can then
     choose to remove or merge the tagged albums. 

     <p>
     <b>Important</b>: If you plan to merge albums, the order in which 
     you tag the albums is important. The first album chosen should be the
     most complete/correct album, and the last tagged album should be the
     least complete/correct album. When the album merge is carried out,
     the second album will be merged into the first album. Then the
     third album will be merged into the first album. Once the album
     merge is complete, all of the data from the merged albums will be
     condensed into the first tagged album.

     <p>
     If you want to stop tagging albums, click on the 
     <a href="/mod/tag/canceltag.html">Cancel Tagging</a> link.

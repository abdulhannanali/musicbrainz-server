The MusicBrainz moderation system is designed to give MusicBrainz users
the power to update and maintain the database. Maintaining a comprehensive
database for popular music is a large task, and MusicBrainz will depend
on its users to spot mistakes in the database and then to take the
initiative to correct these errors. 

<p>
The data in MusicBrainz has been collected from a number of places
including the EMusic collection, metadata submitted via FreeAmp, 
the CD Index database, and freedb.org data. While some of these data
sources are better than others, there will always be mistakes in the
data in MusicBrainz.

<p>
I hope that the people who use MusicBrainz will take it upon themselves
to look up a few of their favorite artists and then make sure there
are no mistakes in their artists metadata. If MusicBrainz can get up to
10,000 users, each user would only need to check out and update a
few artists in order to clean up the entire database.

To moderate (change) the database, follow these steps:

<ol class="body">
<li><a href="newlogin.html">Create</a> a MusicBrainz account and log in. 
Anyone can create an account. We don't ask for any private information, so
there is no chance for us to give this information to anyone!

<li><a href="search.html">Search/browse</a> for your favorite artist
and view the albums by that artist.

<li>If you spot a mistake, a typo, or a mis-classification click on the
Edit link next to the incorrect data item. If you are not logged into
MusicBrainz (see step #1) you will not see these edit links.

<li>The edit link will take you to a page where you can edit the information
for that artist. On the edit page you will find further instructions and
style guidelines for how to edit the data. Please read these instructions --
they are important in order for the entire database to have a consistent
look and feel. If the edit page has more than one field that can be edited, 
but not all fields need to be changed, just leave the correct fields alone.

<li>Once you click on submit on the edit page, you will be taken back to
album/artist page that you just came from. A moderation request will be 
entered into the database, and if you click on the 
<a href="/moderate.html">Moderate</a> button at the top of the page you
will be taken to the moderation page.

<li>The default moderation page lists all the moderations that are currently 
pending.  You may vote on other people's suggestions to edit the database.
Each row
in the moderation table will contain information about the suggested
change and it will show how many peope have voted yes and no to the suggestion.
You may only vote once on a change and you may note vote for your own 
modifications.

<li>For all of the modifications that you have not voted on, you may select
the Yes, No or Abs radiobutton for Yes, No or Abstain (DUH!). You can go down 
the list
of moderations and vote for each by selecting the appropriate radio button
and then clicking on submit at the top of the page. If you are not sure
about a modification or you have no idea if the suggested modification is
correct, then simply abstain from the vote. 

<li>If 5 people unanimously vote for or against a suggested change, the
change is immmediately accepted or rejected, respectively. If the votes
are not unanimous the system will wait for 2 days and then accept the
suggested change into the database if the simple majority of moderators
voted yes. If the vote fails to achieve a simple majority it is dropped
from the moderation table without being applied to the database.

<li>The default moderation page shows new moderations, but you may
also view your past votes or your past moderations by selecting the
Old Moderations and My moderations links at the top of the moderation
table.
</ol>

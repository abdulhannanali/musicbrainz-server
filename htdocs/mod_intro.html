<p>
The MusicBrainz moderation system is designed to give MusicBrainz users
the power to update and maintain the database. Maintaining a comprehensive
database for popular music is a large task, and MusicBrainz will depend
on its users to spot mistakes in the database and then to take the
initiative to correct these errors. 

<p>
The data in MusicBrainz has been collected from a number of places
including the EMusic collection, metadata submitted via FreeAmp, 
the CD Index database, and freedb.org data. While some of these data
sources are better than others, there will always be mistakes in the
data in MusicBrainz.

<p>
I hope that the people who use MusicBrainz will take it upon themselves
to look up a few of their favorite artists and then make sure there
are no mistakes in their artists metadata. If MusicBrainz can get up to
10,000 users, each user would only need to check out and update a
few artists in order to clean up the entire database.

<p> 
Moderators should familiarize themselves with the 
<a href="/style.html">Style Guidelines</a> that define how to organize
and capitalize the data in MusicBrainz. When other Moderators votes on
your suggested changes, they will be judge your changes against these
guidelines.

<p>
<& /comp/section, title=>'Moderation Guide' &>

<p>
To moderate (change) the database, follow these steps:

<ol class="body">
<li><a href="newlogin.html">Create</a> a MusicBrainz account and log in. 
Anyone can create an account. We don't ask for any private information, so
there is no chance for us to give this information to anyone!

<li><a href="search.html">Search/browse</a> for your favorite artist
and view the albums by that artist.

<li>If you spot a mistake, a typo, or a mis-classification click on the
Edit/Move/Add link next to the incorrect/missing data item. If you are not 
logged into MusicBrainz (see step #1) you will not see these edit links.

<li>The moderation links will take you to pages where you can edit/add the 
information for that artist. On the edit pages you will find further 
instructions and links for style guideline popups that will provide a
guidance for your moderation participation. Please read and follow these 
guides -- they are important in order for the entire database to have a 
consistent look and feel. If the edit page has more than one field that can 
be edited, but not all fields need to be changed, just leave the correct 
fields alone.

<li>Once you click on submit on the edit/add pages, you will be taken back to
the album/artist page that you just came from. A moderation request will be 
entered into the database, and if you click on the 
<a href="/moderate.html">Moderate</a> button at the top of the page you
will be taken to the moderation page, where you can view/vote on moderations.

<li>The default moderation page lists all the moderations that are currently 
pending.  Please vote on other people's suggestions to edit the database.
Each row
in the moderation table will contain information about the suggested
change and it will show how many peope have voted yes and no to the suggestion.
You may only vote once on a change and you may not vote for your own 
modifications.

<li>For all of the modifications that you have not voted on, you may select
the Yes, No or Abs radiobutton for Yes, No or Abstain (DUH!). You can go down 
the list
of moderations and vote for each by selecting the appropriate radio button
and then clicking on submit at the top of the page. If you are not sure
about a modification or you have no idea if the suggested modification is
correct, then simply abstain from the vote. 

<li>If <% &DBDefs::NUM_UNANIMOUS_VOTES %> people unanimously vote for or against a suggested change, the
change is immmediately accepted or rejected, respectively. If the votes
are not unanimous the system will wait for <% &DBDefs::MOD_PERIOD %> and then accept the
suggested change into the database if the simple majority of moderators
voted yes. If the vote fails to achieve a simple majority it is dropped
from the moderation table without being applied to the database. Some
moderations, such as the add album moderation, will add data into
the database at the time the moderation is entered into the system. If
such moderations get voted down, the data that was entered for the moderation
will be removed from the database.

<li>The default moderation page shows new moderations, but you may
also view your past votes or your past moderations by selecting the
Old Moderations and My moderations links at the top of the moderation
table. The expiration times show on the moderation page are in GMT.
</ol>

<h2>Auto Moderators</h2>

<%perl>

use URI::Escape;

my $mb = $m->comp("/comp/dblogin");
my $mod = Moderation->new($mb->{DBH});
my $moderator_list;

my $list = $mod->GetAutomoderatorList();
foreach my $user (@{$list})
{
    $moderator_list .= "<a href=\"/moderator.html?user=" . uri_escape($user) . 
                       "\">$user</a>, ";
}
chop($moderator_list);
chop($moderator_list);

$list = $mod->GetAutomoderationList();
my $moderation_list = join(", ", @{$list});

</%perl>

<p>
Automoderators are moderators who have made a large number of contributions 
to MusicBrainz, and some basic moderations made by automoderators are not
required to be voted on by other moderators. The following moderation types
are automoderations:
</p>

<blockquote>
<% $moderation_list %>
</blockquote>

The following moderators are automoderators:

<blockquote>
<% $moderator_list |n %>
</blockquote>

<p>
The policy for suggesting more automoderators is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Any automoderator can suggest a new moderator to be promoted to an automoderator.</li>
<li>The suggested moderator must then be endorsed by two other automoderators.</li>
<li>Once endorsed, the automoderators have one week to vote on the promotion of the endorsed automoderator. A simple majority is required to be promoted.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Any moderator who suggests or endorses a moderator cannot vote on the new 
moderator. The suggesting/endorsing/voting will happen in the mb-users 
mailing list and should be facilitated by the moderator who suggests the 
new moderator.
</p>

<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'March 2nd, 2003: Server Updates' &>

<pre>
Changes since the last release (10 Feb 2003):

Tagger

- a lot of people were experiencing problems uploading anything more
than a small amount of TRM data at a time, using the Tagger.  This was
due to some server code which was too slow, the client was "timing out"
waiting for it.  The offending code has now been sped up a lot, so you
shouldn't see that error any more.

- when showing TRM collisions in the tagger, sort the albums by artist
and show the artist name

- when showing found albums/tracks in the tagger, show the album
attributes (e.g. "Official Album", "Official Various Artists
Compilation").  Also show the track length.

- when a discid has just been added (via the tagger), show the album
you've just added the discid to.

- fixed a bug whereby sometimes "various artists" albums were not
returned to the tagger



Moderating

- login names, as well as passwords, are now case-sensitive

- ensured that the "related artist" data is maintained for artist
removals and artist merges

- when merging artists or moving an album, the "source" artist is never
shown as a possible match.  Also a full search is done for artists (e.g.
if you enter "Bach", you'll get every artist matching "Bach", not just
J.S.Bach)



Other web updates

- the MusicBrainz IRC channel is now logged and archived!  You can see
the archives here: http://musicbrainz.org/archives/irc/ .  There's a
link to that page on the "contact us" page.

- fixed a bug whereby sometimes an album's displayed discid/TRM/track
counts were incorrect

- various textual pages updated, especially the front page, the Finances
page, and the download page

- My and Rob's TODO lists are now much more up-to-date (and are much
more likely to be /kept/ up-to-date, since it's now easier for us to
do).  However, these pages aren't really there on the staging server,
but trust me, they'll be there when it goes live.

- general re-working of some HTML to be more "modern", making more use
of CSS



Other (non-web) server updates

- various fixes and improvements relating to importing and exporting data.

<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'March 29th, 2003: New Database Server' &>

<pre>

On Saturday, 29th March 2003 the new database server (hostname 'bender')
was put into production.  This server was purchased with your donations
- thanks!  It's great.  We're very happy about this :-)

At about 1155hrs UTC, the system was put into "read-only" mode (which
means that logins were disabled, and logged-in users were logged out).
Then the database was exported to text files, transferred to bender,
then imported into a fresh database.  At about 1220hrs UTC, the web
server was configured to start using the newly-created database, and
the old database was shut down.

We've tried to make sure that no data could have been written to the
system during the upgrade process - such data would be lost when the
final switchover occurred.  Please let us know if you think we missed
anything.

Once again, thanks for your donations, which made this possible!  We hope
to be able to bring you a faster, more reliable, easier-to-use service
as a result.


Dave Evans

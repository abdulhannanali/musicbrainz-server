Change Log for mb_server
========================

- Added EMail verifiction support: When a returning user logs in, the
  user will be prompted to verify or blank out their email address.  New
  users can specify a email address when creating their account.  The
  moderator profile now supports changing the email and sending out
  confirmation emails. 

- Moderators can now send mail via the 'send email' links in the
  profiles page or the moderation page. 

- Moderators also get mailed when a new note is attached to one of their
  moderations.

- The support for looking up various artist albums in the FileLookup
  interface has been improved, and should make the tagger behave a little
  better.  However, the tracks for VA albums are not being returned via the
  web service yet -- that is scheduled for the next update since
  libtunepimp needs it.

- Added an explanation of automoderators and which moderations qualify
  for automoderation to the moderation intro. This page now also lists
  which moderators are automoderators.

- There is now a "List Failed Moderations" page (for you, or any other
  moderator).  (Patch by Duncan Findlay)

- As well as showing mods by artist, you can also show them by album.  This
  functionality is quite limited though; it's primarily intended to find the
  original "Add Album" mod and any "Edit Album Name" mods, and it *may*
  also find other mods (e.g. move album, edit album attributes, remove album).
  It *won't* find mods for each of the tracks on the album (e.g. edit track
  name).

- The voting page now performs stronger validtion, including checking that
  the user is logged in.

- Previously if you did a "move disc id" moderation, then the album
  meta-information (including the number of disc IDs each album has) was not
  updated - thus, the disc ID icon would remain on the old album, but the disc
  ID itself would move to the new one.  This is now fixed.
  
- The "clientversion" table has now been moved into the "core" dump file
  (mbdump.tar.bz2)

These changes were also made recently:

- A preference was added to control how many moderations are shown on each
  voting page.  The allowed range is 1-25; the default is 10.

- Another preference was added to enable "Add Album" moderations to show
  the whole album within the voting page.

- The "browse various artists" page now allows you to filter by release type
  and release status (e.g. you can browse only soundtracks).

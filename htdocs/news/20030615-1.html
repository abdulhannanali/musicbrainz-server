Change Log for mb_server
========================

- Preferences are now saved (moderator_preferences table, plus internal
  reworking of the "User" code)

- Potential Perl ambiguities and bugs worked around by not using barewords

- Fixed a Mason error which showed up only if a database error occurred
  while entering a mod note (bug #754557)

- sitemenu HTML code now fractionally more compact, tidier

- Where mentioned in the HTML pages, the CVS repository is now cited as
  "cvs.musicbrainz.org", not "zim.musicbrainz.org"

- Channel prefix "#" removed from all "irc://" links

- The two "view mods" links on the "show album" page are now "show
  artist mods" and "show album mods" (bug #754314)

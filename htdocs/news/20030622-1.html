Artist Subscriptions
--------------------

On each artist page (showartist.html or artistinfo.html) you'll see a
"Subscribe" link; use this link to subscribe to this artist.  To see your
list of subscriptions, click the "Subscriptions" link on your profile page
(moderator.html).  From there you can unsubscribe whichever artist you don't
want in your list any more.

Once a day, the system will look for any moderations added for your subscribed
artists, and e-mail you with a list looking a bit like this:

  Faith No More (0 open, 5 applied)
  http://musicbrainz.org/moderate.html?type=4&amp;artistid=1005
  
  Green Jelly (0 open, 8 applied)
  http://musicbrainz.org/moderate.html?type=4&amp;artistid=49435
  
  Madonna (4 open, 7 applied)
  http://musicbrainz.org/moderate.html?type=4&amp;artistid=89

The list tells you how many open and applied moderations have been added to
each of your subscribed artists.  Artists with no new moderations are not
included.  If there are no new moderations for your artists, no e-mail is
sent.

You must be a registered user, and have a validated e-mail address, to use
this feature.  Please note that, even though it's called "Subscriptions",
it's free :-)  Finally, please be assured that, like your saved preferences,
your list of subscribed artists is not made publicly available.

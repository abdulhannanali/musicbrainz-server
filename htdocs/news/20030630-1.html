Change Log for mb_server
========================

Import from FreeDB
------------------

The process of importing a release from FreeDB has been rewritten.
The improvements include:

* Previously it was easy to miss the "CD has multiple artists" tick box,
  and hence get the import wrong.  Now the user is quite obviously asked
  to make a clear choice (with no default) as to whether a single artist
  or multiple artists are involved.

* All artists can be searched for, using the same technique as is used for
  entering a "change track artist" moderation.

* All fields have a "Guess Case" button; also, for single artist releases,
  there is a "Guess All" button.  "Smart Quotes" are fixed (replaced by
  apostrophes) by default.

* At any stage it's easy to go back and change your earlier answers, without
  losing any later answers.

Also, releases imported from FreeDB (both automatically and manually) should
now have their track lengths set.

 
Other Changes
-------------

There is now an "Edit Artist Alias" moderation type, so you don't have to
delete and re-add an alias to change it.  See the "Edit" links on
/showaliases.html.

Previously add links to add a note to a moderation required Javascript to
work.  This has now been fixed.

For "Add non-album track" moderations, the (meaningless) track number is
no longer displayed.

A couple of security flaws relating to moderation notes have been fixed.

There is now a script to fix "smart quotes" in bulk (activated by the
server administrators).

The nightly database dump archives (mbdump*.tar.bz2) now each include a
TIMESTAMP file.  This will make it easier to identify exactly when each dump
was taken, and to check that a set of dump files belong together.

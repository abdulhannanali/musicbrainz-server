Change Log for mb_server
========================

Moderation notes: when entering moderations, you now get the chance to enter a
moderation note at the same time as entering or confirming the moderation
itself.  Previously it was actually quite hard work to add notes to your own
moderations, to explain why you were entering a particular mod; now it's easy.
This should hopefully encourage the use of moderation notes to make voting on
"difficult" or odd-looking moderations easier.  This change applies to all
moderation types apart from: Add TRM, Change Track Artist, Move Disc ID,
Convert Release to Single Artist.  These moderation types will be dealt with
later.

"Edit Album Attributes" moderation: when adding a moderation of this type, any
releases whose attributes already match the "new" attributes are now quietly
removed from the list (because there is nothing to change).  If the list
becomes empty as a result, no moderation is entered.  Thus there will be no
more moderations which say (for example) "Old: Album, Official; New: Album,
Official".

Moderator emails: moderators' names shown in e-mail headers (e.g. when it
shows your name in the "To:" header) are now displayed correctly much more
often.  Internally, all of the e-mail code has been rewritten, to make it
easier to maintain and extend the code.  Proper UTF-8 support has been added
for e-mail subject lines (the message body was already handled correctly).

Server errors: in the highly unlikely ;-) event that you should experience a
server programming error of some kind, instead of being presented with a big
ugly list of error messages, you now just get a much nicer-looking "500 Server
Error" message.  (The error messages are now written to the server error log).

Login / account creation: Bug #752767 "@Q@ in URL" has been fixed.  Also, when
you log in you will now never be redirected to the login page again, nor to
the logout page.  (When this used to happen it was very confusing!).  If you
see the "you must log in" box whilst trying to do something, and you choose to
create a new account, you are now redirected back to the correct page once
your account has been created.

Some obscure and intermittent HTML- and URL-encoding bugs have been fixed.

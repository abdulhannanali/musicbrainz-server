<h2>MusicBrainz Tagger 0.10.0</h2>

<h3>libtunepimp: new MB Tagger core</h3>

<p>
The tagger has undergone many changes since 0.9.0 -- the most
important difference is that the core tagging features now
reside in the libtunepimp library and the MB Tagger is nothing
more than a glorified shell around libtunepimp. libtunepimp
compiles on Win32, Linux and Mac OS X and will be released
seperately in the next few days.
</p>

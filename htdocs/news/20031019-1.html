<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Users</h2>

<h3>Album Editor</h3>

<p>
The Album Editor lets you edit all sorts of aspects of an album on (almost)
one screen.&nbsp; Currently this means you can edit the album name and
attributes, and the track names and numbers (and yes, there are lots of "Guess
Case" buttons to play with).&nbsp; You can also add and remove tracks.&nbsp;
The Album Editor is found under a link called "Edit All" on each album.
</p>
<p>
So far there are a few limitations which you should know about:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>It only works for single artist albums
		(don't worry, there will be a multiple-artists version).</li>
	<li>When you click the "Enter Moderations" button when you're done,
		you still get the same moderations we currently have - for
		example, 1 x "Edit Album Name" + 10 x "Edit Track Name" + 1 x "Edit Album
		Attributes".&nbsp; A future version will probably enter a single
		"Modify Album" moderation encompassing all of these things, in order to
		(hopefully) make voting easier.&nbsp;
		See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=816269&amp;group_id=19506&amp;atid=119506">bug #816269</a>.</li>
	<li>You can't use the Album Editor on [non-album tracks].</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other Changes</h3>

<p>
If you choose to show the whole album when reviewing "Add Album" mods,
there is now an extra preference which, when enabled, causes the "Edit" links
to be shown on those albums.&nbsp; This saves a page load when you want to
edit the album, at the expense of making the moderation pages a bit bigger.
</p>
<p>
"Merge Artists" mods now merge by artist ID, not name.&nbsp; This means that
if the target artist is renamed whilst the merge is open, then the merge
should still succeed.&nbsp; Also, both the source and destination artists are
marked as "mod pending".
</p>
<p>
"Remove TRM Id" mods were previously problematic if they had to be undone
(e.g. if they failed the vote).&nbsp; This has now been fixed.&nbsp; If the
TRM cannot be re-added then the ModBot may note "Unable to re-insert
TRM".&nbsp; This will only happen on "Remove TRM Id" mods inserted before this
server update, but closed after; mods inserted after the update will be OK.
</p>
<p>
When the ModBot added a note to your moderations the e-mail used to say:
"Unfortunately moderator 'ModBot' has not supplied their e-mail address,
so you can't reply to them.".&nbsp; This message has been removed.
</p>
<p>
The "page selector", used on the moderation pages and the browse artists /
browse albums pages, now appears both above and below the things you're
browsing.
</p>
<p>
When moving a Disc ID, [non-album tracks] releases are now not offered as a
possible place to move it to.
</p>
<p>
"Guess Case" now also knows about the following words:
album original single (lower case, if inside brackets);
ft. (becomes feat.); and finally, LP EP BWV and the Roman numerals I to X.
</p>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Programmers</h2>

<p>
Nothing new in this release.
</p>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Server Programmers</h2>

<p>
When DBDefs::DB_STAGING_SERVER is set, a "Debug" link appears in the nav
bar.&nbsp; This takes you to /debug.html, a page which displays your session
data etc.&nbsp; Currently the debug.html page can be accessed even on the live
server, but this may change in future.
</p>

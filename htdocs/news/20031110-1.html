<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Users</h2>

<h3>Moderation Search</h3>

<p>
	Previously it was only possible to list moderations using one of a number of
	fixed means: for example, "New Mods", "FreeDB Mods", "Artist Mods"
	etc.&nbsp; Now, all of these have been replaced a rather flexible
	<a href="/mod/search/index.html">Moderation Search</a> facility.
</p>

<p>
	Moderation Search allows you to find moderations according to any
	combination of the following criteria: moderation status, automod flag,
	moderation type, moderator, vote cast (by you or anyone else),
	artist (including "my subscribed artists"), and moderation ID (range).&nbsp;
	You can also query by album, or by track.&nbsp;
	Finally you can choose whether to show them oldest to newest, or the other
	way round.&nbsp; The number of possible combinations is
	simply astronomical.
</p>

<p>
	The old, fixed search types ("New", "FreeDB" etc) now simply pre-fill the
	search form with the appropriate values.&nbsp; So for example, you can run
	one of the preset searches (say, "My Failed Mods"), and then click "Advanced
	Search" to customise your current search in whatever way you please.&nbsp;
	There's <a href="/mod/search/select-filter.html">a new page</a> which lists
	the presets.&nbsp; If you like you can <a href="/prefs.html">set a new
		preference</a> to cause the "Moderate" link in the top navigation bar to
	go to that page instead of running the "New Mods" query.
</p>

<p>
	Some other points of note:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Many more queries than before are possible.&nbsp; For example, show me
		moderations by (some moderator name) which I haven't voted on yet; or, show
		me (some moderator name)'s automods only.
	</li>
	<li>
		Many of the moderation URLs have now moved.&nbsp; Hopefully all the links on
		the site have been updated, but if you do hit an old link (e.g. in an old
		"subscriptions" e-mail) you should get redirected.
	</li>
	<li>
		The "subscriptions" e-mails now contain an extra link, which is
		effectively like "New Mods", but for your subscribed artists only.
	</li>
	<li>
		There's now <a href="/mod/search/select-moderator.html">a page where you
		can search for moderators</a> (so you can include them in your
		search).&nbsp; Interestingly this is currently the only place in the whole
		site where you can effectively "browse moderators".&nbsp; No doubt a page
		dedicated to doing just that will be added some time in a future release.
	</li>
	<li>
		Sometimes your moderation searches may "time out" - just like normal
		searches (for tracks, etc) the search is cancelled if it's still running
		after 30 seconds.&nbsp; If this happens, try narrowing down your search,
		maybe by using the "moderation ID" filter (e.g. only where the ID is at
		least 530000).
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Add Album</h3>

<p>
	The manual "Add Album" pages now have "Guess Case" and "Guess Sortname"
	buttons.
</p>

<h3>Other Changes</h3>

<p>
	Previously only two statistics were recorded for each moderator; a count of
	"accepted moderations", and one of "failed moderations".&nbsp;
	Now the "accepted" count has been split into two, one for auto-moderations,
	and one for the rest; and the "failed" count has also been split into two,
	one for "failed vote" moderations, and one for the other types of
	failure.&nbsp; For example, see <a href="/user/view.html">your own profile page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	When moving an album to another artist, the original artist is no
	longer shown in the search results (bug #576354).
</p>

<p>
	Each moderation type has a name, and just to ensure that the name of each
	type is unique, two of the types have been renamed.&nbsp;
	Previously there were two types of "Add Track" (one used up to
	17th August 2001, and one used thereafter); now the former is called
	"Add Track (old version)".&nbsp;
	Additionally there are in fact two types both known as "Merge Albums" (one
	for single-artist albums, and one for Various Artists).&nbsp;
	The latter is now called "Merge Albums (Various Artists)".
</p>

<p>
	The "auto-notes" added by the Album Editor (e.g. "The first of a set
	of 3 moderations") were previously recorded against the moderator's own
	name; now, they are added by the ModBot.
</p>

<p>
	If you use the "compact" album listing, then manually switch to a "full"
	listing, the expand/collapse links now work, instead of switching you back
	to a "compact" listing.
</p>

<p>
	There is now a new moderation suggestions report, called "Superfluous Data
	Tracks".&nbsp; Thanks to our script/report writer,
	<a href="/user/view.html?modname=matt">Matthias Friedrich</a>, for
	this.&nbsp; This report lists albums which include a final "data track",
	but have no Disc ID.
</p>

<p>
	Also in the are of suggestions reports: the "bad entries" report
	now does HTML-escaping properly.&nbsp; The "unknown" report also now does
	this; it also runs much more efficiently, shows counts of how many tracks
	and artists it found, and correctly includes the page footer.
</p>

<p>
	Voting more than once on a moderation sometimes caused that moderation to
	show up twice when it should not - this is now fixed (bug #829524).
</p>

<h2>New and Changed Documentation</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="/development/cvs-modules.html">CVS Modules</a>
		- this page lists all the modules in CVS, and for each one gives a brief
		description and includes the current development status (current,
		obsolete).
	</li>
	<li>
		The <a href="/products/server/index.html">MusicBrainz Components</a>
		diagram has been updated to show the Relatabe TRM Signature Server.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="/docs/20031108-2.html">How TRM Generation Works</a> and
		<a href="/docs/20031108-1.html">Dissecting a Tagger Session</a>
		describe the workings of the Tagger in more detail.
	</li>
</ul>
		
<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Server Programmers</h2>

<p>
	Added help text to the INSTALL file and to MBImport.pl, stating that
	the current live SQL scripts must be used to import a live dataset.
</p>

<p>
	RDFDump - the RDF dump file (link) is now valid XML.  Previously it tried to
	put long lines of hyphens ("-----" etc) within a comment (bug #829181).
</p>

<h2>Bugs and RFEs Closed</h2>

<& buglist.inc,
	"576354 Source artist isn't filtered out",
	'829181 RDF dump not valid XML',
	'829524 Changing vote makes duplicate moderations appear',
	'829525 Add a "Website bugs" category (invalid)',

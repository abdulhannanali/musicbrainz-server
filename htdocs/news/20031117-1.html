<h2>MusicBrainz Tagger 0.10.2</h2>

<p>
This version fixes a few important bugs from the 0.10.1 version.&nbsp; Files that were
tagged by clicking on the tag icon may have incomplete artist sortname and artist id
tags.&nbsp; The saved tab can now be sorted by clicking on the header fields, and the
filename in the tabs will never be cut off -- now it gets reasonably truncated 
and the most important info should always be visible.&nbsp; Finally FLAC tagging had
some bugs where tags were getting cleared or not written to disk.

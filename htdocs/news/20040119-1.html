<p>
	Not many changes today.&nbsp; Well, we did have a main release only
	two days ago!
</p>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Users</h2>

<p>
	Matthias Friedrich and Wendell T. Hicken have created two new reports:
	one listing
	<a href="/reports/generated/DuplicateAlbums/">duplicate albums</a>
	and another one with
	<a href="/reports/generated/DuplicateArtists2/">more duplicate artists</a>.
</p>

<p>
	"Guess Case" will now put "(bonus disc)" (or "disk") in lower case.
</p>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Server Programmers</h2>

<p>
	The database import script is now potentially much faster
	(down from 2 hours to 20 minutes).&nbsp; It also no longer asks two
	questions at the start, so it's easier to run it completely unattended.
</p>

<p>
	The unused "trmstats.pl" script has been removed.
</p>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Users</h2>

<p>
	Bug #874401 has been fixed.&nbsp; This bug meant that when you added
	"Various Artist" albums, any sortnames you specified for new artists
	were ignored.&nbsp; Now you can specify both the name and sortname as
	you create the artist, as you'd expect.
</p>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Programmers</h2>

<p>
	Web service changes: release dates, and release type and status have been
	added to the <tt>QuickTrackInfoFromTrackId</tt> query.&nbsp; This query uses
	the same RDF prepresentation that the <tt>GetAlbumFromGlobalId</tt> function
	returns.&nbsp; This query will be deprecated for the next version of the web
	service; the <tt>QuickTrackInfoFromTRMId</tt> function has also been
	deprecated.
</p>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Server Programmers</h2>

<p>
	We're switching over to use
	<a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">Memcached</a> for our cacheing
	implementation (after a short spell with <tt>Cache::SizeAwareFileCache</tt> at the
	last release).&nbsp; Of course this means you'll probably want to install
	Memcached on your machine if you want to run a MusicBrainz server.
</p>

<p>
	Some obsolete cleanup scripts have been ditched, and "RemoveBadTOCs.pl" has
	been completely rewritten (and renamed).
</p>

<p>
	In <& cvslink.inc, "mb_server/cgi-bin/Discid.pm" &>,
	<tt>_FindFreeDBEntry</tt> has been removed - it wasn't used any more, and if
	we had happened to invoke it there was a nasty bug in there waiting to bite,
	which would have caused data corruption of the TOC table.
</p>

<h2>ChangeLog</h2>

<p>
The following changes were made for 2.1.1:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Return special TRMs for special conditions for TRM generation:
    <blockquote>
    c457a4a8-b342-4ec9-8f13-b6bd26c0e400  -- Sigserver busy and overloaded<br>
    f9809ab1-2b0f-4d78-8862-fb425ade8ab9  -- Source file is too short to calculate TRM<br>
    7d154f52-b536-4fae-b58b-0666826c2bac  -- File is slience<br>
    </blockquote>
</li>
<li>
If the TRM signature server becomes overloaded, it will now start
returning HTTP 503 error codes and the TRM generator will catch that
and return the Sigserver busy TRM shown above.
</li>
</ul>

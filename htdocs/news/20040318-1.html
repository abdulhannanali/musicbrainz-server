<h2>MusicBrainz Tagger 0.10.3</h2>

<p>
This bug fix version fixes problems in the id3v2 tags generated by the 
0.10.2 version. This version also supports logging, removing id3v2 tags 
from ogg files, sports new toolbar icons, shows special <em>too short</em>
and <em>silence</em> trms.
</p>

<p>
With the increased load on the TRM signature server tagging clients may encounter
TRM server busy messages and the tagger now captures those and reminds the user
to donate money to MusicBrainz when the TRM server becomes busy. The tagger also
supports the new %type (album type), %status (album status), %year, $month, %date
(for first release date of the album) and %country (first release country)
variables for the saving tagged files. These values are now also written to
the metadata tags.

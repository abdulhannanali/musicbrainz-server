<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Users</h2>

<h3>Revamped Support for Disc IDs</h3>

<p>
	Duplicate disc IDs are now allowed.&nbsp; As a pleasant
	side-effect you can now
	<a href="/bare/cdlookup.html?id=a70de90c">search for albums based on FreeDB ID</a>
	as well as <a href="/bare/cdlookup.html?id=N0PIEPQKetVqSGHUzm8S.mKeUoI-">by disc ID</a>.&nbsp;
	You can also inspect the disc ID details much more closely than before.
</p>

<h3>FreeDB</h3>

<p>
	<b>FreeDB Moderations</b>, (the mechanism whereby MusicBrainz automatically
	imports data from FreeDB with no human intervention),
	has been <b>turned off</b> - no more "FreeDB mods".&nbsp;
	You can still do a <a href="/freedb/freedb.html">manual FreeDB import</a>
	if you like.
</p>

<p>
	Also, MusicBrainz now uses "FreeDB protocol 6", which means much better
	Unicode support when importing albums.
</p>

<h3>Automoderator Elections</h3>

<p>
	At the end of an election, if the nominee was accepted, the system can now
	make the successful candidate into an Automod without needing manual
	intervention from the server administrators.&nbsp; It can't yet subscribe
	the new auto-moderator to the "mb-automods" mailing list, however.
</p>

<p>
	While voting is open, the tally of votes cast so far is now hidden to all
	apart from the proposer, the seconders and the candidate.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not logged in, the automod voting page now displays a more
	helpful message than before.
</p>

<p>
	Special "system" users (ModBot etc) can no longer be nominated for
	auto-moderator status.
</p>

<p>
	A small typo was fixed in the e-mails sent by The Returning Officer.
</p>

<h3>Other Changes</h3>

<p>
	<b>Artist Search</b>: a bug was causing the artist search index to become
	corrupted.&nbsp; The bug has been fixed and the index has been rebuilt.
</p>

<p>
	<b>FreeDB Imports</b>: the notes added by the ModBot, giving the URL of the
	original FreeDB data, are no longer mailed to the original moderator.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Add Album</b>: when adding an album, both album attributes now default
	to "not known" instead of "Album, Official".
</p>

<p>
	<b>Miscellany</b>: a "Copy" button has been added to the "edit artist"
	page.&nbsp; The instructions for anonymous CVS access have been fixed.&nbsp;
	"Guess Case" has been tweaked again.
%# TODO describe
	The MusicBrainz data dumps now include Amazon cover art URLs.
</p>

<h2>New and Changed Documentation</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/about/mirrors.html">MusicBrainz Mirrors</a></li>
	<li><a href="/products/picard/index.html">Picard</a>,
		and a <a href="/products/picard/tutorial/index.html">Picard Tutorial</a></li>
	<li>New Q/A's have been added to <a href="/tagger/faq.html">the Tagger FAQ</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Server Programmers</h2>

<p>
	The <& cvslink.inc, "mb_server/INSTALL" &> file has been further updated,
	describing the installation process more fully and more helpfully than ever
	before :-)
</p>

<p>
	<& cvslink.inc, "mb_server/admin/InitDb.pl" &> now does a much better job
	of creating the replication function.&nbsp; You can use
	<kbd>--with-pending=FILE</kbd> to tell it where to find <tt>pending.so</tt>.
</p>

<p>
	Various scripts (MBImport.pl, ImportReplicationChanges,
	LoadReplicationChanges) now check the status of completed sub-processes more
	carefully.
</p>

<p>
	<& cvslink.inc, "mb_server/admin/cleanup/FixLength.pl" &> now runs every
	night.&nbsp; It has been made more robust too - it reports any errors it
	encounters and keeps running, and it also shows the IDs of any albums it
	can't fix.
</p>

<p>
	Only one instance of <& cvslink.inc, "mb_server/admin/replication/LoadReplicationChanges" &>
	is now allowed at a time.
</p>

<p>
	<& cvslink.inc, "mb_server/admin/replication/ProcessReplicationChanges" &>
	now deletes "pending" data as it is processed, which means that if the
	script is stopped (or crashes) we can safely restart where we left
	off.&nbsp; Several options have also been added to help with
	troubleshooting.
</p>

<& /comp/sidebar, title => 'November 4th, 2004: TRM Database Pruned' &>

<p>
	At about 1930hrs UTC on August 9th the TRM database
	was "pruned" again (see <a href="/news/20040809-1.html">the previous time</a>
	for more information about this).&nbsp;
	This time we removed all TRMs apart from the ones attached to
	MusicBrainz tracks, where the TRM had been looked up at least once.&nbsp;
	This is a slightly more aggressive prune compared to the previous time.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	The TRM database is now about
	<a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/mrtg/bender.cgi?log=bender-datsize"
		>40% of the size</a> it was before, which (like last time) means that
	it now fits easily into the server's memory, so the server as a whole
	runs <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/mrtg/zim.cgi?log=zim-trmtaken">quickly</a>
	and <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/mrtg/zim.cgi?log=zim-trmstats">reliably</a>.

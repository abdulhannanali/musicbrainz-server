<h2>Changes mainly of interest to MusicBrainz Users</h2>

<h3>"Add Disc ID" Moderations</h3>

<p>
	Whenever a disc ID is added to an existing album, it is now tracked
	via an "Add Disc ID" moderation.&nbsp; This applies both to disc IDs added
	via the "CD lookup" interface (in which case the moderation is credited to
	whoever performed the lookup), and also to those added as a result of a
	FreeDB lookup (which fall under the "FreeDB" moderator).&nbsp;
	"Add Disc ID" moderations are <em>not</em> used in the case where
	an album and a disc ID are added at the same time.
</p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>

<p>
	Annotations allow you to add notes to artists and albums.&nbsp;
	See <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/wiki.pl?HowAnnotationsWork">How Annotations Work</a>
	and the <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/wiki.pl?AnnotationFAQ">Annotations FAQ</a>.&nbsp;
	Thanks to Matthias Friedrich for building the foundations of this feature.

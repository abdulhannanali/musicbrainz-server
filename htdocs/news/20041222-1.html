<p>
	At about 2200hrs UTC on December 22nd the TRM database
	was "pruned" again.
	As we did last time, we removed all TRMs apart from the ones attached to
	MusicBrainz tracks, where the TRM had been looked up at least once.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Just before the prune we had about 3632598 TRMs; after the prune we had about 1989632.&nbsp;
	For pretty pictures illustrating this, check out our
	<a href="/mrtg/">MRTG pages</a>.

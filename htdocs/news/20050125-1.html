<p>
	At about 2300hrs UTC on January 25th the TRM database
	was "pruned" again.&nbsp;
	As we did last time, we removed all TRMs apart from the ones attached to
	MusicBrainz tracks, this time using the additional criterion that
	the TRM had to have been looked up at least twice.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Just before the prune we had about 3633572 TRMs; after the prune we had about 1898435.&nbsp;
	For pretty pictures illustrating this, check out our
	<a href="/mrtg/">MRTG pages</a>.

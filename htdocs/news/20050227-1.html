<p>
	At about 1100hrs UTC on January 25th the TRM database
	was "pruned" again.&nbsp; Here are the pertinent facts and figures:
</p>

<pre>
* the criterion used was: select trm from trm where lookupcount > 0;

* before the prune,
 * the TRM server contained 3540483 TRMs,
 * the MB database contained 2199812 TRMs, of which 206335 had never been looked up

* after the prune,
 * the TRM server contained 1993316 TRMs
  * although the sigserver said "Read 1978201 total signatures from all indexes"
</pre>

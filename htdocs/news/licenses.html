<h2>Data Licenses</h2>

<p>
MusicBrainz used to use the much 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">discussed</a> and 
often flamed <a href="http://opencontent.org">Open Content</a> license. Given 
the controversy of this license combined with the issue that 
<a href="/papers/mb_license.html">facts cannot be copyrighted</a> in the United States,
we have decided to change the licenses that MusicBrainz uses.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain"><img 
   alt="Public Domain Dedication" border="0" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"
   src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/norights-a.gif" /></a>
The core MusicBrainz metadata consists of the artist, artistalias, album, track,
CD Index id, CD table of contents, and TRM Id data. This core data has now been
placed explicitly into the 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain">Public Domain</a>, 
since this data is a large collection 
of facts and facts cannot be copyrighted. Furthermore, by placing this data into the
Public Domain, MusicBrainz is making this data available for use far and wide by 
commerical and non-commercial groups and individuals.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0"><img 
   alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"
   src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20.gif" /></a>
The remaining portions of the MusicBrainz dataset consist of the derived text 
indexes, moderation data and data contributed by third parties. All of this data
has been released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License</a>. This license allows anyone to use the work, as long as they give the MusicBrainz community proper credit, use it in a non-commercial setting and if they make
modifications, they need to release the modified work under the same license. Please
read the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0-legalcode">full terms</a>
of this license before you <a href="/products/server/download.html">download</a> the
MusicBrainz data.
</p>

<a href="/papers/mb_license.html">Data License Issues White Paper</a> and our
<a href="/papers/mb_nonprofit.html">Non-Profit White Paper</a>.

<h2>Source Code Licenses</h2>

<p>
MusicBrainz still uses the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"><abbr title="General Public License">GPL</abbr></a> for its <a href="/products/server/index.html">Server</a> 
and <a href="/tagger/download.html">Tagger</a> source code</a>. The 
<a href="/products/client/index.html">client source code</a> uses the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html"><abbr title="Lesser General Public License">LGPL</abbr></a>.

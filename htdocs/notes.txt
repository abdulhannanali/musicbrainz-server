Overall page layout
-------------------

Across the page at the top:
   A) Musicbrains logo in the left hand side
   B) Some sweeping line that goes across the top of the page,
      similar to the line across the page of my.yahoo.com

In the left hand column:
   A) Navigaton (5-6 items on where to go in the page)
   B) Related sites (3-4 related sites)
   C) Statistics (3-4 items -- number of albums, artists, ids)

   Each of the items in the left hand colum could be seperate boxes
   like the slashboxes on the right side on slashdot, or the left
   hand boxes on freshmeat.

Other page items:
   A) A section divider that allows me to divide sections of content
      on a page. http://www.freeamp.org/index.html?mode=download has
      large black boxes that serve this purpose. I'd like to have some
      thing that serves the same purpose, but not as klunky.

General page stuff:
-------------------

1) Don't use frames
2) Light/simple use of graphics

Pages that I really like: (for look and feel)
-------------------------

1) freshmeat.net 
2) Thinkgeek.com
3) guru.com 


Color Scheme:
-------------

The text on the pages should have a white background. Possible schemes:

1) orange/blue (orange should not be too obnoxious)
2) purple/white (with some very pale yellow)

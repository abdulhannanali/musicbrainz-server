<b> Introduction </b>

<p>
The MusicBrainz project currently distributes its dataset using the OpenContent license. 
However, the Free Software Foundation frowns upon this license, and it really isn't 
suited for licensing factual data as it turns out. Given these issues, what license should 
be used for distributing the MusicBrainz dataset?


<p>
What is wrong with using the OpenContent license?

<p>
MusicBrainz uses the <a href="http://opencontent.org">OpenContent license</a> to make the data in the MusicBrainz 
server available to the public. This license hopes to be a GPL analogue license for 
general content (music, pictures, stories, etc.) and is not specifically designed to handle 
data that resides in an SQL server.

<p>
Richard Stallman has some objections to the OpenContent license and the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">GNU web page</a> states:

<p>
<blockquote>
This license does not qualify as free, because there are restrictions on
charging money for copies.  We recommend you not use this license. 
</blockquote>

<p>
If OpenContent does not solve the problems that MusicBrainz faces, then what license 
does? I like the spirit of the GPL, and I've considered using the GPL for MusicBrainz, 
but GPL uses software specific terms like source code, object code, and executable all 
of which do not apply to data. Richard Stallman suggested using the GNU Free 
Documentation License, but that license is specific to documentation and uses terms 
like title pages, appendices, and cover texts. This license feels like trying to force a 
square peg into a round hole, and I don't think it would provide adequate protection for a 
data set in a court of law.

<p>
After endless hours of research trying to find a fitting license I've come to the conclusion 
that none exist that can cover the issues that arise from trying to apply the Copyleft 
concept to a database. Simply trying to define what constitutes a derivative work for a 
database is a frustrating experience. 

<p>
Consider the following issues:

<ul>
<li>Is a derivative work created when someone takes some data from a Copyleft 
database, combines it with some data from a proprietary database and then 
displays the data to a customer? What if that customer is or is not charged for 
access to that database?
<li>It would seem that importing one column from a Copyleft database into a 
proprietary database would constitute a derivative work. But, what if a user 
inserts row identifiers from a Copyleft database into a proprietary database in 
order to cross reference them? 
<li>If someone takes some data from a Copyleft database and adds it to their own 
web page, is their web page now subject to the same license that covers the 
database?
</ul>

<p>
A license that protects the contents of a database should be able to address the 
concerns above. This may seem like a tall order already, but the situation gets more 
complicated. In the 1991 case of Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service 
Company, Inc., the US Supreme Court ruled that a database (a compilation work) must 
contain a minimum level of creativity in order to qualify for copyright protection 
(<a href="http://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/database.html">source</a>). 
Merely listing factual data in an alphabetic listing is not enough, and anyone can legally 
extract portions (short of the whole compilation) of the database for their own use.

<p>
<center><b>Put bluntly, factual data cannot be copyrighted.</b> </center>

<p>
To date, the data collected in MusicBrainz is 100% factual -- this will change over time 
as MusicBrainz starts collecting data like music reviews and genre listings. However, 
given the Feist decision, how can we protect the MusicBrainz data?


<p>
<br>
<b>Detailed Problem Analysis</b>

<p>
Instead of looking for one license that can cover the MusicBrainz data, we must now 
look for a license to cover the non-factual data and we must come to terms with the 
reality that factual data cannot be copyrighted.

<p>
Factual data cannot be copyrighted in the United States -- in the European Union and in 
lots of other countries of the world factual data can be copyrighted. But with the US as 
the weakest link in the chain to protect the data, it will be impossible to protect the data 
even if the MusicBrainz project were located outside of the US. Consider this scenario:

<p>
A citizen of a European country travels to the United States and 
downloads most (but not all) of the portions of the MusicBrainz data. 
Perhaps this person takes all of the data, except for a few obviously bad 
metadata entries. This person then exports the dataset by returning to the 
EU. Finally, said person can then take this dataset and apply a copyright 
notice and begin using and/or selling this data to other EU customers. 
While this may not be morally correct, it is perfectly legal.

<p>
Regardless of the license that MusicBrainz applies to the data, the above is legal. Lets 
assume for a moment that the MusicBrainz community decides to release the data 
under the GPL. The GPL assumes that copyright law applies to the source code/data 
and proceeds to give the licensee a set of rights, as long as the licensee abides by 
terms of the GPL. If the licensee violates any portion of the GPL, the GPL becomes null 
and void, and the licensee is now in direct violation of copyright law.

<p>
The EU citizen in the example above exports the GPL dataset back to the EU and then 
begins to sell copies of the data. That action is a clear violation of the GPL, which then 
causes the GPL to no longer apply, thus falling back to the existing copyright laws. But 
in this case, there are no copyright laws to fall back upon, and thus the 
MusicBrainz community has no legal recourse against the immoral citizen.

<p>
The end result is that there is no way to protect factual data. Period.

<p>
On the other hand, factual data cannot be copyrighted, and the MusicBrainz community 
should seek for or define a suitable license for the non-factual metadata. We'll cover this 
topic in much greater detail later.


<p>
<br>
<b>A New Approach</b>

<p>
If the factual data in MusicBrainz cannot be protected, do I just stop hacking and get a 
real job? 

<p>
No. We need to examine our beliefs and our preconceived notions about having to 
protect our dataset. At the first <a href="http://codecon.info">CodeCon Conference</a> Fred von Lohmann, who is a 
staff attorney for the EFF, suggested that the community stop trying to protect the 
dataset and instead focus on how to ensure that the dataset will always be available to 
the community.

<p>
Fred’s comments suggest a simple method for resolving the license issues that is not 
fraught with paradoxes and complex legal documents. Rather than restricting who and 
why someone can use the dataset, we simply need to ensure that the data has a 
permanent home that cannot be compromised by greed or other malicious activities.

<p>
The thought of letting go of control of the MusicBrainz data will be a new one for the 
MusicBrainz community. The concept itself is not new at all -- the most prominent 
example of letting go of control comes from Linus Torvalds. Linus, the creator of the 
Linux kernel which makes up the core of the GNU/Linux operating system, made the 
source code to his kernel available to the public in 1991, and thus relinquishing ultimate 
control over the code. Letting go of control over the kernel sources has spurred the 
development for Linux and its consequent rapid adoption in the industry.

<p>
The same will be true for MusicBrainz. Letting go of control of the data and explicitly 
placing the factual metadata into the Public Domain will make the metadata more useful 
than it is today. I am even willing to argue that we're holding back the MusicBrainz 
project by trying to protect the data.


<p>
Data has no intrinsic value. Data with relationships to other data has some value. Data 
with relationships to lots of other data is more valuable. In essence, the more connected 
a dataset is, the move valuable it becomes. Consider Metcalfe's law:

<p>
<blockquote>
Metcalfe's Law states that the usefulness, or utility, of a network equals 
the square of the number of users.
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe that Metcalfe's law applies to data as well:

<p>
<blockquote>
The usefulness, or utility, of a dataset equals the square of the number of 
relationships contained in the dataset.
</blockquote>

<p>
The more people/projects/companies use and link against the MusicBrainz dataset, the 
more useful the dataset will become. Each new relationship in the dataset and external 
relationships to and from the dataset will increase its value. Only by making the dataset 
freely available, without restrictions on its use, can the MusicBrainz dataset realize its 
full potential.


<p>
<br>
<b>Threat Analysis</b>

<p>
Lets assume that the MusicBrainz factual metadata will be explicitly released into the 
Public Domain. What threats exist that may make this move undesirable? Two threats 
become apparent:

<p>
<ol>
<li>The M$ threat: M$ downloads the data and creates a service that sells this data 
to its customers. M$ makes money off the backs of the MusicBrainz community.
<li>The GN threat: GN purchases all of the MusicBrainz intellectual property, data 
and the souls and bodies of the creators of MusicBrainz. GN shuts down 
MusicBrainz and offers the same service for a fee to its customers.
</ol>

<p>
These threats may seem serious at first glance, but a detailed breakdown shows that 
theses threats don't amount to much. In the first threat, M$ would have a hard time 
selling a product that is available for free to its customers. The free software community 
would make its voice heard (as it has in the past) and create an overwhelming negative 
PR nightmare for M$. The uproar from the community would make it clear that the 
service for which M$ had been charging is available for free at MusicBrainz. The idea of 
starting a service to charge for what is available for free is not a sound business 
practice.


<p>
M$ could also choose to add extra value to the product offering in order to charge 
money for the service. This concept is actually endorsed by the GPL, and thus is not 
really a threat. Furthermore, M$ could refuse to contribute changes back to the 
community. This means that they need to create  the tools to update and maintain the 
dataset or take the MusicBrainz server source code and adapt it for their own use. 
Either one of these approaches costs lots of money in engineering time -- it would be 
cheaper to let the established MusicBrainz community take care of the maintenance of 
the dataset.

<p>
However, we all know that M$ has lots of money, and lets assume that they develop 
their own tools for data maintenance. It is unlikely that the paying M$ customer base 
would be willing to help maintain the dataset as the MusicBrainz community does. M$ is 
not known for having customers with noble goals about open communities. Thus, M$ 
would be forced to maintain the dataset themselves, and this translates into ongoing 
expenses, which are harder to justify than one time expenses. The dataset would also 
suffer in quality, since M$ cannot possibly have the breadth of users that MusicBrainz 
enjoys. M$ would be better off to have a friendly relationship with MusicBrainz and to 
send their customers to MusicBrainz for data maintenance.

<p>
The GN threat is even less important, if we take a few preventative steps. Fred von 
Lohmann suggests that we form a non-profit corporation that has the express bylaws 
that state that the MusicBrainz dataset must always be made available to the public. 
Furthermore, a US non-profit corporation cannot be bought by another corporation; in 
order to dissolve a non-profit corporation, its assets must be donated to another non-
profit corporation. This will ensure that the assets of MusicBrainz cannot be legally 
acquired and locked away from the public. 

<p>
And in the case that GN acquires the souls and bodies of the creators of MusicBrainz, 
the other members of the MusicBrainz community will take action to isolate 
compromised elements of MusicBrainz. And as stated earlier -- an isolated data set is 
worth a lot less than a well connected dataset.

<p>
In order for MusicBrainz to protect itself it must take a few legal and technical steps to 
ensure that the availability of the data cannot be compromised and that it is easier to 
work with MusicBrainz than to work in isolation.


<p>
<b>The New Solution in Detail</b>

<p>
A comprehensive solution to the MusicBrainz data license dilemma will require separate 
solutions for the factual and the non-factual metadata. The following steps propose such 
a solution:

<p>
<ol>
<li> All factual metadata should be explicitly placed into the Public Domain, thereby 
acknowledging that factual metadata cannot be copyrighted.

<li> A MusicBrainz non-profit corporation should be created, which should adopt a set 
of bylaws that state that MusicBrainz will make all factual metadata created by 
the MusicBrainz community available to anyone who wishes to download the 
data.
<li> The non-profit corporation should establish a number of partnerships with groups 
like the Creative Commons or the Free Software Foundation, to mirror the 
MusicBrainz data. Having a neutral third party make the data available ensures 
fair access to the dataset and acts as a backup in case the MusicBrainz non-
profit should cease to exist.
<li> The MusicBrainz community should work to identify any issues that arise from 
applying the Copyleft concept to a database of non-factual metadata. Defining a 
derivative work and to what extent linking to and using non-factual metadata is 
allowed under the Copyleft concept are only a few of the issues that need to be 
addressed.
<li> MusicBrainz should work with the established free software/open source license 
experts such as Richard Stallman and Eric Raymond to define a new license that 
addresses the complexities of applying the Copyleft to non-factual metadata. 
Creating a license that is derived from the GPL or other licenses that have had 
public scrutiny would be a great benefit to creating a solid license that can 
withstand an attack in a court of law.
</ol>


<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>

<p>
The OpenContent license is not the right license for MusicBrainz, and as far as I can 
tell, no appropriate license for data has been created yet. This white paper serves as a 
call for participation for creating an appropriate license. If you have any thoughts on this 
matter, please take a moment to <a href="mailto&#x3a;rob&#x0040;musicbrainz.org"> share them with me</a>
me or the <a href="/list.html"> MusicBrainz community</a> in general.

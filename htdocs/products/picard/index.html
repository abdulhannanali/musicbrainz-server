<h2>How to get the new tagger</h2>

<p>
To download this new (beta) project, go to the <a href="https://helixcommunity.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=171">Helix Community download page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Things that do work:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open files into [Drags tracks here] by doubleclicking file
<li>Drag files, and directories into [ drag tacks here ]
<li>Drag files into specific album slots
<li>Drag files/dirs into album name slot, auto match tracks to album
<li>Save files
<li>Remove files/albums
<li>Cluster unmatched files into album clusters
<li>Basic preference dialog features
</ol>

<h2>Things that need to be done, but are not done:</h2>

<h3>General</h3>
<li>Not all options are hooked up yet.
<li>No keyboard shortcuts for drag and drop operations
<li>There is no way to generate a TRM for a file
<li>All files that have no MB ids in their tags will always end up in the
    unmatched tracks folder when dropped onto [Drag your tracks here] -- use
    the Cluster button to cluster these unmatched files into album clusters.
<li>The application exits without asking the user to save unsaved files
<li>The genre and comment fields are not read/written from/to music files
<li>Add Helix Community support by using PyPlayer for music preview and
    for mp3 decode support.

<h3>Album Panel</h3>
<li>Should be able to drag albums onto other albums to merge them
<li>Multiple select in the album view does not work

<h3>File Browser</h3>
<li>The file browser does not get updated when files/dirs are saved
<li>The file details should show up in Local mdata when file clicked
<li>Files should have appropriate icons
<li>Dragging directories out of the directory browser will most of the time not
    fully release the dragged item from the dir browser. The drag and drop
    operation will still work, but the dragged item is still 'stuck' to
    the mouse cursor when the mouse cursor is moved over the dir browser.
    Double click in the white area of the dir browser to 'unstick' this item.
    This happens under windows only.
<li>Dragging multiple files from the file listing will cause the all but the 
    clicked item to deselect just before dragging starts. The application
    is smart enough to still drag the right number of items, but it doesn't look
    right -- this happens under Linux only.

<h3>Metadata Information Panel</h3>
<li>The artist and album combo box drop downs do not populate with correct data

<h3>Toolbar, Menus and Appearance</h3>
<li>The application needs a toolbar
<li>The edit menu cut, copy and paste options are not functional yet.
<li>No hourglass cursors are in use yet.

<h3>Platform Specific Issues</h3>
<li>The application has not been tuned for Mac OS X
<li>Application currently runs as a UNICODE application, but ID3 tags are still written in ISO-8859-1

<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'The "Log in permanently" option' &>

<p>
	When you log in, there is a tick box marked "Log in permanently".&nbsp;
	By default this box is not ticked, which means then when you successfully
	log in you'll be sent a single cookie, which will be deleted when you close your
	browser.&nbsp; This means that if you close and restart your browser and come
	back to MusicBrainz, you'll have to log in again.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand if you tick the "Log in permanently" box, then when
	you successfully log in you'll also receive a second cookie, which expires
	in 1 year (which is the maximum recommended lifetime for cookies).&nbsp;
	If you then close and restart your browser and return to MusicBrainz, you'll
	automatically be logged in again.&nbsp; If at any time you click "Logout",
	then both the session cookie and the "permanent" cookie are deleted, and you
	must log in again using the normal means.
</p>

<p>
	Currently the "permanent" cookie contains your MusicBrainz username
	and password <em>in plain text</em>.&nbsp; So please <em>don't</em> use
	this feature if you're logging in from a shared computer (or any other
	computer which you don't exclusively control and trust),
	e.g. if you're using a public computer in a library or Internet Caf&eacute;.

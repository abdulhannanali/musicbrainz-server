<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'The "Only from this IP address" option' &>

<p>
	If you neither know nor care what an IP address is, then you should
	try logging in with this box ticked.&nbsp; If you then find that you're
	being randomly logged out, then you should turn this option off, and log in
	again.
</p>

<p>
	When you log in, there is a tick box marked "Only from this IP address".&nbsp;
	By default this box is not ticked, which means then when you successfully
	log in you'll remain logged in even if you change IP addresses.&nbsp; This
	also applies to the "Log in permanently" option.&nbsp; There is a drawback
	to this however: if someone manages to "steal" your MusicBrainz cookie, then
	they would be able to log as you on another computer.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, if you've got a fixed IP address (or you use a web proxy with
	a fixed IP address), then you could turn on the "Only from this IP address"
	option.&nbsp; This means that your MusicBrainz cookies are only valid when
	used from your IP address.&nbsp; Effectively this means that if someone were
	to steal your cookies, then they could no longer use them to log in as you.

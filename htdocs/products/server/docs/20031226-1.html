<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'The Advanced Search Form' &>

<p>
	The "Advanced Search" form on <a href="/search.html">the Search page</a>
	is actually the same form that <a href="/tagger/index.html">the Tagger</a>
	uses; it allows you to execute a combined search for artist, album and track
	all in one go.
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>
	There is another significant difference between the main search form and
	this one.&nbsp;
	The main search form does an exact word-by-word search (e.g. searching for
	"castle" will never find "castles"); it also shows all results which match
	your search criteria at all.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, the Advanced Search (Tagger) form sometimes uses a more
	flexible search based on the spelling of the words, not the whole words - so
	for example "hate" would now also match "hates", "hat" and "have" (with
	varying degrees of similarity).&nbsp; At the same time, this type of search
	also takes into account the whole name of the track (album, etc) when
	judging how similar they are.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>
	If you search for the album "Boys" by "Tori Amos" (leaving the
	track name blank), then what's actually found is
	<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/89ad4ac3-39f7-470e-963a-56509c546377.html">Toys</a>,
	and NOT <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/album/cf2d8ec9-8dc7-4b6b-9e2e-3db205a434c5.html">Boys for Pele</a>.&nbsp;
	What's happened here is that "Toys" is quite similar to "Boys" - only one
	letter is different - but "Boys for Pele" is quite different - there are two
	extra words!&nbsp; Since there is a similarity threshold below which results
	are not shown, you end up finding one album but not the other.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
	When using the Advanced Search form, it might not be enough to enter one or
	two key words - for best results, enter the whole name of the artist,
	and album and/or track.

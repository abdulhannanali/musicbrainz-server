<& /comp/sidebar, title=>'The "Reveal My E-Mail Address" option' &>

<p>
	Normally when you send a message to other moderators, your e-mail
	address will not be revealed, and the other person will have to reply
	by following a link back to the MusicBrainz web site.&nbsp; This protects
	your privacy, but it can make it rather hard to carry on a coherent
	discussion between moderators.
</p>

<p>
	By enabling the "Reveal my e-mail address" option, the e-mail which is
	then sent will appear to have come directly from your e-mail address.&nbsp;
	This makes it much easier for the other person to reply to you - all they
	have to do is press "Reply".&nbsp; So enabling this option makes two-way
	communication easier, but it does (as its name states) reveal your e-mail
	address to the other party.

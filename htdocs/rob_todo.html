<& /comp/title, title=>"Rob's To Do List" &>

These are the tasks that I am currently working on. The first task the
the most important and the last task is the least important. <p>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'RDF Compliance', 
   skills=>'C++ Programming', 
   desc=>qq\Make the current MB client/server communication completely RDF
            compliant. This involves a new version of the server and the
            client lib.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Improve pending submisson process', 
   skills=>'perl/database programming', 
   desc=>qq\Have the client submit the SHA1 signature of a track along with
            the metadata during a metadata exhange with FreeAmp. This will
            allow the MB server to not accept data into the database that
            comes from two tracks that have the same SHA1 value. Also, 
            store a date when a pending submission was accepted in order
            to remove old submissions. Last, do not accept items into the
            pending table if they do not have complete artist album and
            track information.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Moderation Improvements', 
   skills=>'HTML/Perl', 
   desc=>qq\<ul>
            <li>This is a mixed bag of small issues: add a date field 
                to the moderation tables
            <li>Do not expire moderations that had no votes
            <li>Add a move album function
            <li>Improved (with target artist selection) merge artist function
            <li>Allow users to add a comment why they are voting NO.
            <li>Allow moderators to add a comment as to why their change
                does not follow the style guidelines.
            </ul>\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Failed dependency on changing track numbers', 
   skills=>'perl/database programming', 
   desc=>qq\Some track change moderations are failing with 'failed dependency'
            when they should have succeeded.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Database cleanup scripts', 
   skills=>'perl programming', 
   desc=>qq\<ul>
            <li>Create/run a script that will identify and removed duplicate 
                tracks in albums where one track has a 0 track number.
            <li>Create pages that show potential problem database entries.
            </ul>\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Hanging mysql/rquery.pl processes', 
   skills=>'perl programming', 
   desc=>qq\Some queries never return and cause the rquery.pl process to 
            consume all processor power. Eeek.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'MBDump problem fixes', 
   skills=>'perl/database programming', 
   desc=>qq\The MBDump script does not properly escape all the data placed
            into the XML dump file. Also, change the import script to not
            read all the data into memory at once.\

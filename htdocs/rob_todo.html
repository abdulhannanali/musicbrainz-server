These are the tasks that I am currently working on. The first task the
the most important and the last task is the least important. <p>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Database Replication', 
   skills=>'Perl/Database', 
   desc=>qq\Accept Paul Sharpe's patch, change general server functions
            to allow a read-only mirror to work. All read-write functions
            need to get redirected to the main server.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Database improvements', 
   skills=>'Perl/Database', 
   desc=>qq\Add support for data insertions via RDF with spam prevention,
            and moderate new data insertions.\

   task=>'Add support for merging albums',

   task=>'Improve captitalizaton guidelines', 
   skills=>'Perl/HTML', 
   desc=>qq\The captitalization guidelines need to be updated and improved.
            Perhaps a nice little pop-up window with a quick reference
            guide for capitaliztion would be nice. Has anyone compiled
            a new set of guidelines from the previous discussion?\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Moderation Improvements', 
   skills=>'HTML/Perl',

            <li>Allow moderators to add a comment as to why their change
                does not follow the style guidelines.
            </ul>\

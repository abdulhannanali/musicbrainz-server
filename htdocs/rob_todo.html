<& /comp/sidebar, title=>"Rob's To Do List", expand=>'documentation' &>

These are the tasks that I am currently working on. The first task the
the most important and the last task is the least important. <p>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Support for deleting items from the database', 
   skills=>'HTML/Perl', 
   desc=>qq\Right now there is no way for anyone to delete extra tracks from 
            the database.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Support for moderating DiskIDs/GUIDs', 
   skills=>'HTML/Perl', 
   desc=>qq\MusicBrainz needs to be able to let moderators manage DiskIds
            and GUIDs that are associated with CDs and tracks.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Moderation Improvements', 
   skills=>'HTML/Perl', 
   desc=>qq\This is a mixed bag of small issues:
            <ul>
            <li>Allow users to add a comment why they are voting NO.
            <li>Allow moderators to add a comment as to why their change
                does not follow the style guidelines.
            </ul>\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Improve pending submisson process (complete)', 
   skills=>'perl/database programming', 
   desc=>qq\NOTE: This task is complete, but has not been made active on 
            the server yet. For the next FreeAmp/MBClient release these
            changes will be merged into the main CVS branch and then uploaded
            to the server.<p>
            
            Have the client submit the SHA1 signature of a track along with
            the metadata during a metadata exchange with FreeAmp. This will
            allow the MB server to not accept data into the database that
            comes from two tracks that have the same SHA1 value. Also, 
            store a date when a pending submission was accepted in order
            to remove old submissions. Last, do not accept items into the
            pending table if they do not have complete artist album and
            track information.\

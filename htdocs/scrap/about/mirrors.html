	<div class="content">
		After several years of discussing how to mirror MusicBrainz to the far corners of the world,
		we finally have a replication system in place. Since we're just getting started, we only have one
		mirror to start with for our users in Europe:

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://de.musicbrainz.org">German Mirror (de.musicbrainz.org)</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://nl.musicbrainz.org">Netherlands Mirror (nl.musicbrainz.org)</a></li>
		</ul>
		We're also working on an east coast US and a United Kingdom (.uk) mirror server.

	<div class="label">
		Note to Tagger users:
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		Switching your classic MusicBrainz Tagger
		(0.10.x) to use the mirror server <b>will not improve your TRM lookups</b>. If you are getting
		messages from the tagger stating that the TRM server is too busy, using a mirror server will <b>not</b>
		help you. There is currently only one TRM server located in the US, and that cannot be replicated
		currently. For more information see our <a href="/wd/WindowsTaggerFAQ">Tagger FAQ</a>

	<div class="label">
		What to consider for your own mirror:
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		To set up your own mirror for private or public use, you will need the following:
		<ul>
			<li>A linux machine, (recent distributions work best) with at least 2-3 Gigs
				of available hard drive space. For a private mirror
				(read: used by only a few people) a 1Ghz processor with 256MB of RAM will
				suffice. If you plan to make the mirror available to the public, you should
				have at least a 2Ghz processor with 512MB of RAM. The more RAM, the better!
			</li>
			<li>Bandwidth requirements for a mirror are currently hard to judge -- we're just
				getting started setting up mirrors and our client software is not fully ready to
				take advantage of our mirrors yet. Take a look at our <a href="/usage/www">web
				usage statistics</a> to get an idea how much traffic the main server gets. A mirror
				server would surely use less bandwidth, so this should give you an idea of a
				reasonable upper bound.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>



	<div class="label">
		Installing your own mirror:
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		To install the mirror, you will need to check out the <b>mb_server</b> project from
		<a href="/development/cvs.html">CVS</a> and the follow the instructions in the INSTALL
		file. If you have any trouble setting up the server (it's a fair amount of work, so be
		warned!) post your questions to the musicbrainz-devel <a href="/list.html">mailing
		list</a> and we'll try and help you out.

# Known issues:
#  
# 1. Well, it's my first plugin, and really basic, but I've tested it and it seems to work...
# 2. Not tested with searcg sidebar, as using firefox which doesn't support it.
#
# If you like this, do consider getting involved with MusicBrainz - they're a fab organisation who are trying to put right all the damage to open source philosophies made by the Gracenote CDDB debacle...

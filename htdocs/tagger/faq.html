<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'General Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'The Tagger says the TRM server is too busy at the moment. What does that mean?',
   answer=>'This means that the server that calculates and looks up TRM ids is overloaded with too many users using it at this time. We\'re aiming to deploy a dedicated TRM server sometime in the fall of 2004 to help get us more throughput on TRM lookups. Please <a href="/contribute.html">donate</a> some money to help us purchase a new server.',
   name=>''

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'I switched the tagger to use one of the mirror servers and it still says the TRM server is too busy. What gives?',
   answer=>'There is only on TRM server right now and if you use a mirror server, you will still end up using the same central TRM server as everyone else.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'The Tagger has identified a track even though the server does not have a TRM id for that track. How does that work?',
   answer=>'If the server does not know anything about a given TRM, it will attempt to look up the track from the metadata from the ID3/Vorbiscomment tags and the name of the file. If the data matches a track in the database, the tagger will use this data and consider the track identified.',
   name=>'notrm'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What is a TRM collision?',
   answer=>'A TRM collision occurs if two different tracks have the same TRM id. Acoustic fingerprinting is not an exact science and thus we have to expect a certain number of duplicates and collisions. The tagger makes its best effort to chose the right track when an collision occurs, but sometimes it cannot make an educated guess and then you need to chose the correct track.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'What is a TRM duplicate?',
   answer=>'A TRM duplicate occurs if two different copies of the same music track yield the same TRM id. As mentioned above, acoustic fingerprinting is not an exact science and sometimes the same track encoded with two different encoders or bitrates will yield different TRM ids.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'The track detail page for some tracks show more than one TRM id. Aren\'t the TRM ids supposed to be unique?',
   answer=>'What you are seeing are TRM duplicates for that track. See above.',
   name=>''

<& /comp/faqheader, title=>'Support Questions' &>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'The tagger is supposed to have an embedded web browser. I don\'t see it. What gives?',
   answer=>'You need to have Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher installed for it to work properly.',
   name=>'ie'
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'I have a mp3/ogg/vorbs/wav file that crashes the tagger. Is that useful to you guys?',
   answer=>'Yes. Please <a href="/support/contact.html">contact us</a> about getting the file to us.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'My files keep getting <em>Cannot connect to signature server errors</em>. What can I do to fix this?',
   answer=>'This usually happens to users who are using an automatic proxy setup with Internet Explorer. Go to the options dialog in the Tagger and open the <em>Web Proxy</em> tab. Uncheck the <em>Use Internet Explorer settings for proxy support</em> and then enter your proxy server and proxy port below.',

<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Please read
	<a href="/docs/20031108-2.html">How TRM Generation Works</a>.&nbsp;
	It helps to answer many of these questions.

<& /comp/faqentry,
	question => "How are TRMs generated?",
	answer => qq{
		Please see <a href="/docs/20031108-2.html">How TRM Generation Works</a>.
	},
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Why does the Tagger need to use the Internet to create TRM ids?',
   answer=>'Calculating a TRM Id for a file happens in two steps: 1. the acoustic fingerprint (about 500 bytes) is calculated locally and then sent to the TRM signature server. 2. The signature server then looks at all the previously known TRMs ids and attempts to match the submitted acoustic fingerprint with an existing TRM. If it is not found, a new TRM id is assigned to this fingerprint.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Do you have a version of TRM that does not require using the Internet?',
   answer=>'No. Talking to the signature server is an integral part of calculating a TRM Id.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Can I calculate the acoustic fingerprints and defer the Internet lookup until later?',
	 answer=>qq{
		Technically this is possible, but we do not support it yet.&nbsp;
		A future version of the MusicBrainz client software may support this.
	 },
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Where can I download the source to the TRM signature server?',
   answer=>'You can\'t. It is closed source proprietary software that has been provided by <a href="http://relatable.com">Relatable</a>. We have a contract with Relatable that gives us the privilege to use a binary only version of the signature server.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'Are there any special TRMs?',
   answer=>'Yes, there are. TRM 7d154f52-b536-4fae-b58b-0666826c2bac represents silence, TRM f9809ab1-2b0f-4d78-8862-fb425ade8ab9 indicates the file is too short to calculate a TRM for, and TRM c457a4a8-b342-4ec9-8f13-b6bd26c0e400 is returned when the sigserver is too busy.',
   name=>''
&>

<& /comp/faqentry,
   question=>'You ought to do this and that to the signature server. Can you do that?',
   answer=>'Thank you for making suggestions, but since we do not have access to the source code of the TRM signature server, we cannot make any changes.',

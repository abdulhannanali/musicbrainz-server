MusicBrainz aims to be a comprehensive music database that will
allow people and computers to have meaningful conversations about
music. In order to facilitate these meaningful conversations, MusicBrainz
will need to identify each Artist, Album and Track with a unique identifier.

<p>
Furthermore, MusicBrainz works with the Relatable TRM technology,
which generates an acoustic fingerprint for a digital music file. This
acoustic fingerprint is called the <i>TRM Id</i>. A user will be able
to run an MP3 (or other digital audio file) through a TRM Id generator
like the MB Tagger, and then request the artist, album and track information
from MusicBrainz. With this retrieved information you can then rename the
file and write clean ID3 tags.

<p>
All ids in MusicBrainz look like standard unique identifiers. For example:

<p>
<center><b>95807106-af9f-417d-b1d0-d287c5504ec1</b></center>

<p>
Track Ids are arbitrary ids that are assigned by the MusicBrainz server
when it accepts a track into the database. This id is unique and will
not change over time, so that people can use this identifier to refer
to this track and only this track.

<p>
TRM Ids are assigned by the Relatable TRM signature generator, and look
exactly like other ids in MusicBrainz. However, TRM ids are not guaranteed
to be unique -- due to the quality of an encoding or the quality of a decoder,
tracks that sound the same to a human may yield different TRM ids.

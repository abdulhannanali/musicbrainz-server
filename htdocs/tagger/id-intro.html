			MusicBrainz aims to be a comprehensive music database that will
			allow people and computers to have meaningful conversations about
			music. In order to facilitate these meaningful conversations, MusicBrainz
			will need to identify each Artist, Album and Track with a unique identifier.

			<p>
			All IDs in MusicBrainz look like standard unique identifiers. For example:

			<p>
			<center><b>95807106-af9f-417d-b1d0-d287c5504ec1</b></center>

			<p>
			Track IDs are arbitrary IDs that are assigned by the MusicBrainz server
			when it accepts a track into the database. This id is unique and will
			not change over time, so that people can use this identifier to refer
			to this track and only this track.

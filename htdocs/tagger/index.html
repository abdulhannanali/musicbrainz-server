<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The MusicBrainz Tagger application allows you to automatically look up the tracks in 
your music collection and then write clean metadata tags (ID3 tags or Vorbis comment
fields) to your files. As you tag
the files in your collection that MusicBrainz didn't recognize, you submit the 
acoustic fingerprints (<abbr title="TRM Recognizes Music">TRM</abbr> ids) of your 
files back to the server. Submitting acoustic fingerprints will allow MusicBrainz
to automatically identify these tracks in the future,  so that other people using the 
Tagger can benefit from the work you have done.
</p>

<p>
As the community uses the Tagger application, more and more files will be
automatically recognized. However, as we are just starting to collect the acoustic
fingerprints, fewer files will be initially recognized. So, please 
<a href="download.html">download</a> the Tagger and run your music collection
through it so we can start collecting more acoustic fingerprints. You may also
want to take a look at our <a href="/stats.html">statistics page</a> to see how many
TRM ids we've been collecting recently.
</p>

<p> 
The Tagger is currently only available for Windows. The MusicBrainz team would love
to create an iTunes Tagger plugin for Mac OS X, but we haven't had enough time
to write one yet. It's on our radar -- trust us. We're not intentionally excluding
the Mac community.

In order to submit tagged information you will need to have an account
on the MusicBrainz server. The data you submit to the server will
be labelled with your login name so that other people can see who
contributed these TRM IDs.

<p>
The system is designed to give credit to the people who contribute
to MusicBrainz as well as ensuring that people cannot spam or maliciously
alter the data in the database.

<p>
Creating a MusicBrainz account is simple. Use the link below to create
an account now. Once you've created an account, please

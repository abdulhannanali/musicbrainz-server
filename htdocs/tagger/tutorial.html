<p>
To get started with the MusicBrainz Tagger, select MP3, Ogg/Vorbis or WAV files or whole
folders containing MP3, Ogg/Vorbis or WAV files using the Open Files and Open Folders buttons
on the toolbar of the application:</p>

<center>

</center>

<p>
Once you have selected some MP3/OggVorbis/WAV files the tagger will show the files in
the <i>Pending</i> tab of the file display panel. The tagger will 
automatically start generating the TRM ids and looking up the metadata 
for these files in the background. If the Tagger identifies a file, it will
move the file from the <i>Pending</i> tab to the 
<i>Identified</i> tab. If the tagger does not identify the
file, it will be moved to the <i>Unidentified</i> tab.

<p>
Once tracks start appearing in your <i>Unidentified</i> tab, 
select one track by clicking on the <i>select</i> link. The first track
will be automatically selected for you, and once a track is selected
it is shown with a reddish background. Once you've selected a track
click on the <i>Lookup</i> button and the tagger will use the data in
the current track to jump to the relevant artist/album pages.

<p>
Then, use the MusicBrainz pages to find the track. If the track is not
listed, add it using the the <i>Add Missing Track</i> link shown below
the album (you must be logged in to see this link) or import the album from
Freedb. Once you've located the track, click the Tag link
<img align="center" src="/images/mblookup-tag.gif"> in front of the track name.

<p>
Clicking on the tag icon will automatically download the data for that
track from the MusicBrainz server and then move on to the next 
unidentified track.

<p>
Repeat this process until you have no more <i>Unidentified</i> tracks left
and then click the <i>Write ID3 tags</i> button in the toolbar to write
the ID3 tags and rename your files with the new metadata. Saved tracks
will be removed from the <i>Identified</i> tab.

<p>
Once you've written the ID3 tags to the files, you will also need to click on
the <i>Submit</i> button to submit the TRM and Track Ids that you matched
to the MusicBrainz server. Submitting your data to the server will enter
your matched information into the server database, so that other people who
have the same tracks will have their tracks automatically identified.
The more people use this system, the more tracks it will automatically
recognize, so please submit your tagged information to the MusicBrainz
server.

<p>
If the MB Tagger encounters a problem generating a TRM id for a given
track, the track will be moved to the <i>Error</i> tab. Errors usually occur
in files that the tagger cannot properly decode. 

<p>
The MB Tagger will write the matched Track Ids to the ID3v2 tags, if you've
chosen to write ID3v2 tags. Files that have been run through the tagger
before and have the ID3v2 tags written, will automatically show up in
the <i>Identified</i> tab in subsequent runs. If you'd like to force
a file to be identified again, click on the <i>Identify again</i> button. 

<p>
Good luck and happy tagging!

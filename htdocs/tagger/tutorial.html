To get started with the MusicBrainz Tagger, select MP3, Ogg/Vorbis or WAV files or whole
folders containing these files using the <em>Open Files</em> and <em>Open Folders</em>
buttons on the toolbar of the application.
</p>

<p>
Once you have selected some files the tagger will show the files in
the <i>Pending</i> tab of the file display panel. The tagger will 
automatically start generating the TRM ids (acoustic fingerprints) and 
start looking up the metadata for these tracks in the MusicBrainz server.
If the Tagger identifies a file, it will move the file from the <i>Pending</i> tab 
to the <i>Identified</i> tab and you won't need to do anything else with it for now.
If the tagger does not identify the file, it will be moved to the <i>Unidentified</i> 
tab from which you will need to match the file using the embedded browser.</p>

<p>
If the MB Tagger encounters a problem generating a TRM id for a given
track, the track will be moved to the <i>Error</i> tab. Errors usually occur
in files that the tagger cannot properly decode or if the tagger cannot
contact the TRM fingerprint server to assign a TRM id to the track.
</p>

<br/>
<& /comp/section, title=>"Tagging Unidentified Files" &>

<p>
Once tracks start appearing in your <i>Unidentified</i> tab, 
select a track by clicking on it. After you selected a track, the buttons
to the left become enabled. Use the <em>Lookup</em> button to lookup a track
using the embedded web browser. The <em>Remove</em> button removes a track from 
the tab if you no longer want to work with that track. If the track was previously
identified and you want to have the Tagger identify a track again, click
the <em>Identify again</em> button. If a track was misidentified, you can move
the track to the <em>Unidentified</em> tab by clicking on <em>misidentified</em>,
and then looking the track up again.
</p>

<p>You may also select more than one track by using the shift and control keys
as you would normally select more than one item from any listbox. Also, you can
hit Control-A or select <em>Select All</em> from the Edit menu.
</p>

<p>
To match tracks from the <em>Unidentified</em> tab, select a track and click on the
<i>Lookup</i> button and the tagger will use the metadata from the selected track to 
attempt to look up the track in MusicBrainz. Follow the instructions in the web
pages to find the album that contains the track you're looking for.
</p>

<p>
Once you've located the track, click the Tag link 
<img align="center" src="/images/mblookup-tag.gif"> in front of the track name.
This will automatically download the data for that track from the MusicBrainz server 
and then move the current track to the <em>Identified</em> tab. The next track
in the <em>Unidentified</em> tab will be automatically selected.
</p>

<p>
If an album you're trying to tag does not exist in MusicBrainz, use the <em>Import
from FreeDB</em> links to import an album from FreeDB. If a track was never
released on an album, you can click on the <em>Add non-album tracks</em> link
shown at the bottom of the artist page.
</p>

<br/>
<& /comp/section, title=>"Review Identified Files" &>

<p>
Once you have tagged your unidentified files, click on the identified tab. Tracks in
the identified tab are color coded according to their similarity to the metadata 
found in the track. Tracks with a red background are more likely to be mismatches,
and tracks with a white/grey background are likely to be good matches. Review all
the tracks to ensure that all the tracks have been properly identified and matched.
If a track has been misidentified/mismatched, select the track and click on
<em>Misidentified</em> and then match the track from the <em>Unidentified</em> tab.
</p>

<br/>
<& /comp/section, title=>"Submit TRMs and Write Metadata Tags" &>

<p>
<img src="/tagger/images/submit.gif" style="float: right; margin: .25em;">
When you have reviewed all the tracks and you are certain all the tracks 
have been properly identified, click on the <i>Submit</i> button (the right button) 
to submit the matched TRM Ids to the MusicBrainz server. 
Submitting your data to the server will enter
your matched information into the server database, so that other people who
have the same tracks will have their tracks automatically identified.
The more people use this system, the more tracks it will automatically
recognized, so please submit your tagged information to the MusicBrainz
server.
</p>

<p>Finally, click the <i>Write ID3 tags</i> button (left button) in the 
toolbar to write the ID3 and/or Ogg/Vorbis tags and rename your files with 
the new metadata. Saved tracks will be removed from the <i>Identified</i> tab.
</p>

<p>
The MB Tagger will write the matched Track Ids to the ID3v2/Vorbis comment tags.
Files that have been run through the tagger before and have the ID3v2 tags written, 
will automatically show up in the <i>Identified</i> tab in subsequent runs through
the Tagger. If you'd like to force a file to be identified again, click on the 
<i>Identify again</i> button. 
</p>

<p>
Good luck and happy tagging!

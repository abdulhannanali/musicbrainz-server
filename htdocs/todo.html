If you are interested in helping out with MusicBrainz, this list should
serve as a good starting point to get you started. If you would like to 
help out with a particular task, please <a href="/list.html">subscribe</a> 
to the MusicBrainz mailing list and then post about any questions that you 
might have.<p>

You might also want to check out <a href="rob_todo.html">Rob's To Do list</a>
to see what he is currently working on.<p>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Improved Moderation System', 
   skills=>'perl/database programming', 
   desc=>qq\The current moderation system allows user to edit the data
            in MusicBrainz. However, moderators should also be able to
            delete data, move tracks to other albums, and move albums to
            other artists. Even beyond that, moderators should be able to
            change disk and GUID associations.\

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Testing MusicBrainz', 
   skills=>'General web skills', 
   desc=>qq\Excerise the MusicBrainz site to find the bugs that are lurking 
            somewhere in the code. All features need to get tested: Searching,
            browsing, editing, voting. Any time an error occurs and 
            MusicBrainz does not work properly, please 
            <a href="http://www.freeamp.org/bugzilla">report a bug</a>.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Test & Port the MusicBrainz Client Library', 
   skills=>'UNIX & C/C++', 
   desc=>qq\Download the mb_client project from CVS and compile it on any
            of the supported platorms. The client library has not been
            tested under Solaris, *BSD, IRIX, OS/2, Cygwin (win32). If
            you have access to one of these platforms, please download
            the client and see compiles and runs. If not, I would appreciate
            any patches that fix problems in the client library.\

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Create a Mirror System', 
   skills=>'perl programming', 
   desc=>qq\The MusicBrainz data should be mirrored far and wide to ensure
            that the data is not lost and that people have access to the
            data. Initially a one-way replication system with one central
            server would be ok, but in the future a full bi-directional
            mirror system that allows editing the database on multiple
            servers will be needed.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Add User Profile Functions', 
   skills=>'perl programming', 
   desc=>qq\Currently users cannot do anything but create an account. Users
            should be able to change their password and set a few 
            preferences that customize the behaviour of the web page.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Add more Data Fields', 
   skills=>'perl/database programming', 
   desc=>qq\MusicBrainz should keep track of a lot more data than it currently
            does. It should keep track of web pages that relate to Artists
            and Albums, remix info, cover info and whatever else we see
            fit to track in MusicBrainz. Also, a multiple artist album should
            allow for keeping track of the artist who compiled the album
            in order to give credit where credit is due.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Classical Music Capabilities', 
   skills=>'perl/database programming', 
   desc=>qq\MusicBrainz should also keep track of composers, conductors,
            opus numbers, major keys and information that mainly pertains
            to classical music.\

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Add MusicBrainz to existing players', 
   skills=>'General programming', 
   desc=>qq\Take the MusicBrainz client library and integrate it into
            your favorite digital audio player.\
&>

<& /comp/todoentry, 
   task=>'Automatic Mirror Redirector', 
   skills=>'perl/c/c++ programming', 
   desc=>qq\As MusicBrainz begins to grow and have mirror servers, we
            will need to create a mirror system that allows clients
            to automatically locate a mirror server and use it. This
            will allow MusicBrainz to scale without any one server having
            to carry a greater burden than another server. I've got some 
            ideas about this, but I'm sure there is already a good 
            implementation out there. Please \ . 
            '<a href="mailto:rob@emusic.com">' .
            qq\mail</a> me if you know of something like this.\

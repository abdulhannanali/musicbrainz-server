            somewhere in the code. All features need to get tested: Searching,
            browsing, editing, voting. Any time an error occurs and 
            MusicBrainz does not work properly, please

            of the supported platorms. The client library has not been
            tested under Solaris, *BSD, IRIX, OS/2, Cygwin (win32). If
            you have access to one of these platforms, please download
            the client and see compiles and runs. If not, I would appreciate
            any patches that fix problems in the client library.\

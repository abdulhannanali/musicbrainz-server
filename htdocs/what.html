<& /comp/title, title=>'What is MusicBrainz?' &>

MusicBrainz aims to provide comsumers and music companies with free
access to music <a href="faq.html#metadata">metadata</a>. This 
server will uniquely identify artists, albums/CDs and tracks, and therefore
allow the MusicBrainz users to refer to the artist without any ambiguities.

<p>
MusicBrainz handles two types of digital audio:

<& /comp/listbegin &>
<b>Digital Compressed Audio (MP3/Vorbis)</b><p>
MP3 and <a href="http://www.vorbis.com">Vorbis</a>
are compressed audio standards that take large digital
audio files and compress them down to a reasonable size. These files
may or may not contain metadata, and people will often painstakingly
fill out the metadata fields in their MP3 collections.

<p>
Part of MusicBrainz will be the audio track recognition software that was
recently open sourced by <a href="http://www.relatable.com">Relatable.com</a>.
This software generates a unique signature for an MP3/Vorbis file from the
first 30 seconds of audio data. This unique signature will allow a
client player to look up the metadata in MusicBrainz, and if the metadata
is available, the client can then download the metadata and store it into
the digital audio file for future use. If the data is not available, the
user will be able to enter the metadata for that track and that metadata 
will then be inserted into the MusicBrainz database.

<& /comp/listentry &>
<b>Digital Audio CDs</a></b>

<p>
Audio CDs do not contain metadata either (newer CD-TEXT enabled CDs
do now), and software audio CD players do not know what they are playing.
A few years ago the CDDB system was developed that allowed software
players to look up the metadata for a CD. Later on the creators of the CDDB
system sold it to Escient, who now holds the software cd player industry
in a stranglehold with its restrictive licensing agreements. The CD Index,
which was the predecessor to MusicBrainz also handled the lookup of
audio CDs, and MusicBrainz will be backwards compatible to CD Index
clients.

<p>
Using MusicBrainz, everyone on the net now has one unique way to identify 
a piece of music, which solves the following problems:
<p>

<& /comp/listbegin &>

<b><font size="+1">Music identification:</font></b><p>
Right now Napster does not have a clue what music people are actually 
trading. The files are named by the people who ripped and encoded the file
in the first place, and each person has a slightly different way of doing 
things. Consequently, when a user searches for music on Napster, and the 
are looking <strong>Billy and the Boingers</strong> they won't find tracks 
by someone who errorneously named their files after <strong>Billy and the 
Bongers</strong>. However, MusicBrainz will be able to provide a unique
id for each track, then a user will be able to search for that unique id,
rather than searching by track name.

<p>Of course there are two sides to the coin. The RIAA will also be able
to identify the tracks of its member companies and then be able to go after
people who pirate these tracks. This technology will be created, whether or not we like it -- if we can create the technology and create it in such a fashion
that it benefits everyone, then the internet community wins.

<p>
Another group of people that will win with this system are the Artists. With
the use of MusicBrainz, services like <a href="http://www.fairtunes.com">
FairTunes</a> will be able to create a precise system that will allow users
to compensate artists for the music that they may downloaded without the
permission from the record labels. This way the people who love music can
give money to their favorite artist, while cutting out the record labels.

<& /comp/listentry &>

<b><font size="+1">Playlist Exchange:</font></b><p>
As mentioned above, people who encode MP3 files tend to use their own
favorite file naming scheme. This results in the fact that playlists cannot
be exchanged between users, unless they have exactly the same naming
convention and the same music collection.

<p>These facts pretty much prevent a lot of people from swapping playlists.
Using MusicBrainz unique ids, intelligent MP3 players will be able to create
playlists that contain all the metadata about the playlist as well the unique
ids for each one of the tracks. If user A passes an intelligent playlist to
user B, user B's player can play the playlist because it will be able
to cross reference the items in the user A's playlist with the tracks
in user B's collection. Furthermore, user B can choose to have the player
purchase the missing tracks, or download the tracks from a file swapping
service such as Napster or Scour, and then have the player automatically
tip the artits using FairTunes.

<p>This creates a powerful system that seamlessly enhances the digital 
audio experience and actually funnels money to artists.

<& /comp/listend &>

<p>
The MusicBrainz service is broken into two components: The server and the
client. The server contains all of the metadata and can be 
<a href="search.html">searched</a> and browsed via a normal web browser.
The server also talks MusicBrainz clients. A MusicBrainz client could
be an MP3/Vorbis/AudioCD player such as FreeAmp, WinAmp, XMMS or Sonique.
A client could also be a service like 
FairTunes which could use MusicBrainz in order to properly identify
the Artists that should receive money.

<p>
In order to have complete MusicBrainz support each of these clients can
download the client library (supported on Win32, Linux and various other
UNIX variants) which is released under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
License</a> which allows closed source applications to link to the binary
form of the MusicBrainz client library. There are no royalties or other
fees charged for this.

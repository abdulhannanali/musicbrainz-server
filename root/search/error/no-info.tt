[% WRAPPER "search/error/wrapper.tt" %]
<p>
    Sorry, your query (<code>[% query | html %]</code>) does not
    contain enough information to carry out a search. If you are
    attempting to find something that contains nothing but punctuation
    characters (e.g. !!!) then you need to use the
    <a href="[% c.uri_for("/${type}/browse") %]">browse page</a>, since
    this search ignores punctuation characters
</p>
[% END %]
